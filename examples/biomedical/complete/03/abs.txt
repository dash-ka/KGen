Variants in the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) have been associated with increased risk for sporadic, late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that germline knockout of TREM2 or the TREM2R47H variant reduces microgliosis around amyloid-beta plaques and facilitates the seeding and spreading of neuritic plaque tau aggregates. These findings demonstrate a key role for TREM2 and microglia in limiting the development of peri-plaque tau pathologies.
