Variants in expressed on myeloid cells 2 have been associated with increased risk for sporadic, late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
Here we show that germline knockout of TREM2 facilitates the seeding and spreading of neuritic plaque tau aggregates.
Here we show that germline knockout of TREM2 reduces microgliosis around amyloid-beta plaques.
Here we show that germline knockout of the TREM2R47H variant facilitates the seeding and spreading of neuritic plaque tau aggregates.
Here we show that germline knockout of the TREM2R47H variant reduces microgliosis around amyloid-beta plaques.
These findings demonstrate a key role for microglia in limiting the development of peri-plaque tau pathologies.
