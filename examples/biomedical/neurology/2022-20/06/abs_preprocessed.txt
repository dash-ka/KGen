voltagegated potassium channel subfamily which is important for sustained highfrequency firing
kcnc2 encodes kv3 2 a member of the kv3 voltagegated potassium channel subfamily
voltagegated potassium channel subfamily which is important for sustained optimized energy efficiency of action potentials in the brain
the objective of this study was to analyze the clinical phenotype
the objective of this study was to analyze genetic background
the objective of this study was to analyze biophysical function of diseaseassociated kv3 2 variants
individuals with kcnc2 variants were selected for clinical
individuals with kcnc2 variants were selected for functional analysis
individuals with kcnc2 variants were selected for further genetic
kcnc2 variants detected by exome sequencing
cases were referred through clinical collaborations
cases were referred through research collaborations
selected de novo variants were examined electrophysiologically in xenopus laevis oocytes
we identified novel kcnc2 variants in 18 patients with various forms of epilepsy including genetic
genetic generalized developmental encephalopathy including myoclonicatonic epilepsy
genetic generalized developmental encephalopathy including earlyonset absence epilepsy
genetic generalized epilepsy encephalopathy including myoclonicatonic epilepsy
genetic generalized developmental encephalopathy including focal epilepsy
genetic generalized epileptic encephalopathy including earlyonset absence epilepsy
genetic generalized epileptic encephalopathy including myoclonicatonic epilepsy
genetic generalized epilepsy encephalopathy including focal epilepsy
genetic generalized epileptic encephalopathy including focal epilepsy
genetic generalized epilepsy encephalopathy including earlyonset absence epilepsy
10 were de novo
of the 18 variants
8 were classified as modifying variants
seizurefree using valproic acid in epileptic encephalopathy cases
seizurefree using valproic acid in severe developmental
seizurefree using valproic acid as monotherapy
eight drugresponsive patients became seizurefree
seizurefree using valproic acid in combination
functional analysis of 4 variants demonstrated gain of function in 3 severely affected developmental encephalopathy cases with a milder phenotype as the underlying pathomechanisms
functional analysis of 4 variants demonstrated gain of function in 3 severely affected loss of function in 1 case with a milder phenotype as the underlying pathomechanisms
functional analysis of 4 variants demonstrated gain of function in 3 severely affected epileptic encephalopathy cases with a milder phenotype as the underlying pathomechanisms
these findings implicate kcnc2 as a novel causative gene for epilepsy
these findings emphasize the critical role of kv3 2 in the regulation of brain excitability
