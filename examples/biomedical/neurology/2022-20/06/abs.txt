KCNC2 encodes Kv3.2, a member of the Kv3 voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily, which is important for sustained high-frequency firing and optimized energy efficiency of action potentials in the brain . The objective of this study was to analyze the clinical phenotype, genetic background, and biophysical function of disease-associated Kv3.2 variants .

Individuals with KCNC2 variants detected by exome sequencing were selected for clinical, further genetic, and functional analysis . Cases were referred through clinical and research collaborations . Selected de novo variants were examined electrophysiologically in Xenopus laevis oocytes .

We identified novel KCNC2 variants in 18 patients with various forms of epilepsy, including genetic generalized epilepsy, developmental and epileptic encephalopathy including early-onset absence epilepsy, focal epilepsy, and myoclonic-atonic epilepsy . Of the 18 variants, 10 were de novo and 8 were classified as modifying variants . Eight drug-responsive patients became seizure-free using valproic acid as monotherapy or in combination, including severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy cases . Functional analysis of 4 variants demonstrated gain of function in 3 severely affected developmental and epileptic encephalopathy cases and loss of function in 1 case with a milder phenotype as the underlying pathomechanisms .

These findings implicate KCNC2 as a novel causative gene for epilepsy and emphasize the critical role of KV3.2 in the regulation of brain excitability .
