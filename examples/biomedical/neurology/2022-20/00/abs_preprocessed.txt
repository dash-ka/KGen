neurofilament light appears to be a promising fluid biomarker in repeatexpansion spinocerebellar ataxias with piloting studies in mixed spinocerebelar ataxia cohorts
mixed spinocerebelar ataxia cohorts suggesting that neurofilament light might be increased at the ataxic stage of spinocerebelar ataxia type 1
we here hypothesized that neurofilament light is increased not only at the ataxic stage of spinocerebelar ataxia1
we here hypothesized that neurofilament light is increased not only at neurofilament light preataxic stage

forty individuals with spinocerebelar ataxia1 were enrolled including 11 preataxic individuals
11 preataxic individuals converting to the ataxic stage
forty individuals with 89 controls were enrolled including 11 preataxic individuals
serum neurofilament light levels were increased at the preataxic stage compared to controls
controls yielding high agecorrected effect sizes
serum neurofilament light levels were increased at the ataxic stage compared to controls
serum neurofilament light increases were paralleled by increases of csf neurofilament light at both the preataxic
serum neurofilament light increases were paralleled by increases of csf neurofilament light at both ataxic stage
in preataxic individuals serum neurofilament light levels increased with proximity to predicted ataxia onset with significant serum neurofilament light elevations already 5 years before onset
in preataxic individuals serum neurofilament light levels confirmed in preataxic individuals with actually observed ataxia onset
serum neurofilament light increases were detected already in preataxic individuals with spinocerebelar ataxia1 without volumetric atrophy of cerebellum suggesting that serum neurofilament light might be more sensitive to early preataxic neurodegeneration than the currently known most changesensitive regions in volumetric mri
serum neurofilament light increases were detected already in preataxic individuals with spinocerebelar ataxia1 without volumetric atrophy of pons suggesting that serum neurofilament light might be more sensitive to early preataxic neurodegeneration than the currently known most changesensitive regions in volumetric mri
using longitudinal serum neurofilament light measurements we estimated sample sizes for clinical trials with the reduction of serum neurofilament light as the endpoint
