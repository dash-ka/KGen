cardiovascular risk factors have a recently established association with cognitive decline and dementia yet most studies examine a recently established association through crosssectional data precluding an understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of such risk
the current study aims to explore how the ongoing trajectory of cardiovascular risk affects subsequent dementia decline risk
the current study aims to explore how the ongoing trajectory of cardiovascular risk affects memory decline risk
we hypothesize that an accelerated longterm accumulation of cardiovascular risk as determined by the framingham risk score will be more detrimental to cognitive state outcomes than a stable cardiovascular risk
we hypothesize that an accelerated longterm accumulation of cardiovascular risk as determined by the framingham risk score will be more detrimental to dementia state outcomes than a stable cardiovascular risk
we assessed an initially healthy communitydwelling sample
an initially healthy communitydwelling sample recruited from the prospective cohort betula study
cardiovascular disease risk as assessed by dementia status were measured at each 5year time point across 20 to 25 years
cardiovascular disease risk as assessed by the framingham risk score were measured at each 5year time point across 20 to 25 years
cardiovascular disease risk as assessed by episodic memory performance were measured at each 5year time point across 20 to 25 years
analysis was performed with bayesian additive regression tree a semiparametric machinelearning method applied herein as a multistate survival analysis method
an accelerated as opposed to a stable cardiovascular risk trajectory predicted an increased risk of developing alzheimer disease dementia
an accelerated as opposed to a stable cardiovascular risk trajectory was associated with an increased risk of memory decline
an accelerated as opposed to a stable cardiovascular risk trajectory predicted an increased risk of vascular dementia
a stable cardiovascular risk trajectory appeared to partially mitigate alzheimer disease dementia risk for apoe epsilon4 carriers
the findings of the current study show that the longitudinal cumulative trajectory of cardiovascular risk is predictive of dementia risk
the findings of the current study associated with the emergence of memory decline
as a result clinical practice may benefit from directing interventions at individuals with accelerating cardiovascular risk
