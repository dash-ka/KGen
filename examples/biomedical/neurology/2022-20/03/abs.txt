Cardiovascular risk factors have a recently established association with cognitive decline and dementia, yet most studies examine this association through cross-sectional data, precluding an understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of such risk . The current study aims to explore how the ongoing trajectory of cardiovascular risk affects subsequent dementia and memory decline risk . We hypothesize that an accelerated, long-term accumulation of cardiovascular risk, as determined by the Framingham Risk Score, will be more detrimental to cognitive and dementia state outcomes than a stable cardiovascular risk .

We assessed an initially healthy, community-dwelling sample recruited from the prospective cohort Betula study . Cardiovascular disease risk, as assessed by the Framingham Risk Score, episodic memory performance, and dementia status were measured at each 5-year time point across 20 to 25 years . Analysis was performed with bayesian additive regression tree, a semiparametric machine-learning method, applied herein as a multistate survival analysis method .

An accelerated, as opposed to a stable, cardiovascular risk trajectory predicted an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease dementia or vascular dementia and was associated with an increased risk of memory decline . A stable cardiovascular risk trajectory appeared to partially mitigate Alzheimer disease dementia risk for APOE Epsilon4 carriers .

The findings of the current study show that the longitudinal, cumulative trajectory of cardiovascular risk is predictive of dementia risk and associated with the emergence of memory decline . As a result, clinical practice may benefit from directing interventions at individuals with accelerating cardiovascular risk .
