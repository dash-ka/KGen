functional connectivity measures can be used to differentiate epileptogenic zones from nonepileptogenic zones in patients with medically refractory epilepsy

antiseizure medication dosages were recorded for days 17 postimplantation was calculated to compare across patients
antiseizure medication dosages were recorded for days 17 postimplantation was calculated to standardize across patients
antiseizure medication dosages were recorded for days drug load score per day was calculated to compare across patients
antiseizure medication dosages were recorded for days drug load score per day was calculated to standardize across patients
functional connectivity was evaluated using directed measures
functional connectivity was evaluated using nondirected measures
standard clinical interpretation of ictal stereoeeg was used to classify brain regions as epileptogenic zones
standard clinical interpretation of ictal stereoeeg was used to classify brain regions as nonepileptogenic zones
over 7 days
partial directed coherence inward strength without accounting for drug load score
presumed epileptogenic zones consistently had higher functional connectivity than nonepileptogenic zones when using between imaginary coherence
directed
nondirected measures were demonstrated to be stable over a shortterm period of 3 consecutive days with the same drug load score
between imaginary coherence functional connectivity differences between nonepileptogenic zones were reduced with drug load score decreases whereas other measures were not affected by drug load score
between imaginary coherence functional connectivity differences between epileptogenic zones were reduced with drug load score decreases whereas other measures were not affected by drug load score
functional connectivity differences between epileptogenic zones were seen during both pseudorest conditions
functional connectivity differences between nonepileptogenic zones were seen during both pseudorest conditions
functional connectivity differences between nonepileptogenic zones were seen during both restingstate conditions
functional connectivity differences between epileptogenic zones were seen during both restingstate conditions
partial directed coherence values
imaginary coherence values were strongly correlated between the 2 conditions whereas partial were not
inward stereoeeg functional connectivity is higher in presumed epileptogenic zones vs nonepileptogenic zones are stable over time
nondirected stereoeeg functional connectivity is higher in presumed epileptogenic zones vs nonepileptogenic zones are stable over time
nondirected stereoeeg functional connectivity is higher in presumed epileptogenic zones vs measures are stable over time
inward stereoeeg functional connectivity is higher in presumed epileptogenic zones vs measures are stable over time
certain measures may be affected by antiseizure medication dose as between imaginary coherence differences between epileptogenic zones
partial directed coherence
however
other measures such as partial are poorly correlated across recording conditions
nonepileptogenic zones are less pronounced with lower doses
these findings allow novel insight into how these findings are influenced by antiseizure medications
these findings allow novel insight into how stereoeeg functional connectivity measures may aid surgical localization
these findings allow novel insight into how these findings are influenced by other factors
