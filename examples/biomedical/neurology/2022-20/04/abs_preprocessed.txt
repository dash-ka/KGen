the mechanisms remain to be determined
physical activity has been associated with a decreased risk for dementia
the mechanisms underlying this association
our objective was to assess whether cardiovascular risk factors mediate the association between brain integrity markers in older adults
our objective was to assess whether cardiovascular risk factors mediate the association between physical activity in older adults
at baseline participants from the agewell study underwent cardiovascular risk factors collection
at baseline participants from the agewell study underwent multimodal neuroimaging
at baseline participants from the agewell study completed a physical activity questionnaire
multiple regressions were conducted to assess this association among physical activity
multiple regressions were conducted to assess this association among neuroimaging
multiple regressions were conducted to assess this association among cardiovascular risk factors
mediation analyses were performed to test whether cardiovascular risk factors mediated the associations between physical activity and neuroimaging
higher physical activity was associated with body mass index
higher physical activity was associated with lower insulin level
higher physical activity was associated with the other cardiovascular risk factors
lower insulin level were related to cerebral glucose metabolism
lower insulin level were related to higher gray matter volume
body mass index were related to higher gray matter volume
body mass index were related to cerebral glucose metabolism
when controlling for insulin level the association between cerebral glucose metabolism remained unchanged while the association with gray matter volume was lost
when controlling for insulin level the association between physical activity remained unchanged while the association with gray matter volume was lost
when controlling for body mass index the association between cerebral glucose metabolism remained unchanged while the association with gray matter volume was lost
when controlling for body mass index the association between physical activity remained unchanged while the association with gray matter volume was lost
when body mass index were entered in the same model only body mass index remained a significant predictor of gray matter volume
when insulin level were entered in the same model only body mass index remained a significant predictor of gray matter volume
mediation analyses confirmed that insulin level mediated the association between physical activity
mediation analyses confirmed that insulin level mediated the association between gray matter volume
mediation analyses confirmed that body mass index mediated the association between gray matter volume
mediation analyses confirmed that body mass index mediated the association between physical activity
analyses were replicated within regions sensitive to alzheimer disease remained overall similar
analyses results remained overall similar
the association between physical activity is mediated by changes in insulin level
the association between gray matter volume is mediated by changes in insulin level
the association between physical activity is mediated by changes in body mass index
the association between gray matter volume is mediated by changes in body mass index
in contrast the association with cerebral glucose metabolism seems to be independent from cardiovascular risk factors
older adults engaging in physical activity experience cardiovascular benefits through the maintenance of a lower body mass index resulting in greater structural brain integrity
older adults engaging in physical activity experience cardiovascular benefits through insulin level resulting in greater structural brain integrity
