clinicopathologic factors contributing to mild cognitive impairment reversion to normal cognition
to identify clinicopathologic factors
we analyzed 3 longitudinal cohorts in this study
clinical outcomes were compared between patients with mild cognitive impairment with or without an experience of reversion to normal cognition
demographic characteristics were compared between patients with mild cognitive impairment with or without an experience of reversion to normal cognition
we also compared longitudinal changes in amyloid load in a subcohort of nonreverters in mcsa with mri
we also compared longitudinal changes in tau load in a subcohort of reverters in mcsa with mri
we also compared longitudinal changes in tau load in a subcohort of nonreverters in pet imaging information from multiple visits
we also compared longitudinal changes in cortical thickness in mcsa with mri
we also compared longitudinal changes in glucose metabolism in pet imaging information from multiple visits
we also compared longitudinal changes in amyloid load in a subcohort of nonreverters in pet imaging information from multiple visits
we also compared longitudinal changes in amyloid load in a subcohort of reverters in pet imaging information from multiple visits
we also compared longitudinal changes in tau load in a subcohort of reverters in pet imaging information from multiple visits
we also compared longitudinal changes in tau load in a subcohort of nonreverters in mcsa with mri
we also compared longitudinal changes in cortical thickness in pet imaging information from multiple visits
we also compared longitudinal changes in glucose metabolism in mcsa with mri
we also compared longitudinal changes in amyloid load in a subcohort of reverters in mcsa with mri
cox proportional hazards regression models showed that mild cognitive impairment reverters had an increased chance of being cognitively normal at the last visit in rosmap
cox proportional hazards regression models showed that mild cognitive impairment reverters had an increased chance of being cognitively normal at a reduced risk of progression to dementia
cox proportional hazards regression models showed that mild cognitive impairment reverters had an increased chance of being cognitively normal at the last visit in nacc
cox proportional hazards regression models showed that mild cognitive impairment reverters had an increased chance of being cognitively normal at the last visit in mcsa
compared with mild cognitive impairment nonreverters reverters had betterpreserved cortical thickness
compared with mild cognitive impairment nonreverters reverters had glucose metabolism
compared with mild cognitive impairment nonreverters reverters had lower levels of amyloid albeit statistically nonsignificant
however no difference in tau load was found between nonreverters
however no difference in tau load was found between reverters
mild cognitive impairment reversion to normal cognition is likely attributed to betterpreserved cortical structure
mild cognitive impairment reversion to normal cognition is likely attributed to glucose metabolism
