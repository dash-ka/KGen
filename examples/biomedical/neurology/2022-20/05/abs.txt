To identify clinicopathologic factors contributing to mild cognitive impairment reversion to normal cognition .

We analyzed 3 longitudinal cohorts in this study . Demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between patients with mild cognitive impairment with or without an experience of reversion to normal cognition . We also compared longitudinal changes in cortical thickness, glucose metabolism, and amyloid and tau load in a subcohort of reverters and nonreverters in MCSA with MRI or PET imaging information from multiple visits .

Cox proportional hazards regression models showed that mild cognitive impairment reverters had an increased chance of being cognitively normal at the last visit in MCSA, ROSMAP, and NACC and a reduced risk of progression to dementia . Compared with mild cognitive impairment nonreverters, reverters had better-preserved cortical thickness and glucose metabolism and lower levels of amyloid, albeit statistically nonsignificant . However, no difference in tau load was found between reverters and nonreverters .

mild cognitive impairment reversion to normal cognition is likely attributed to better-preserved cortical structure and glucose metabolism .
