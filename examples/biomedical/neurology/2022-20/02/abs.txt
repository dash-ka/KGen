Subarachnoid hemorrhage from cerebral aneurysm remains a devastating disease with high mortality and morbidity . Cerebral aneurysm and its rupture are more prevalent in postmenopausal women and have been postulated to be hormonally influenced . The goal of this study was to investigate the associations of female-specific factors, including reproductive life span, age at menarche, and age at menopause, with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in women .

Participants in the Nurses Health Study were followed up from 1980 or the time of reaching menopause until 2018 . Only women with natural menopause or surgical menopause due to bilateral oophorectomy were included . Reproductive life span was defined by subtracting the age at menarche from the age at menopause . Multivariable-stratified proportional hazards models were used to study reproductive life span, age at menarche, and age at menopause with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage . Multivariable models were adjusted for age, race, smoking, hysterectomy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, body mass index, hormone therapy use, oral contraceptive use, and parity .

A shorter reproductive life span was associated with a 2-fold higher incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage after multivariable adjustment . Early age at menopause was similarly associated with a higher risk of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, but age at menarche was not . Use of oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone therapy was not associated with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage .

An earlier age at menopause and a shorter reproductive life span duration were associated with a higher risk of incident aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in women . No associations were noted for age at menarche, parity, oral contraceptive use, or postmenopausal therapy use .
