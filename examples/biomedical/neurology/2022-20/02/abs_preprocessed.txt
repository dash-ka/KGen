subarachnoid hemorrhage from cerebral aneurysm remains a devastating disease with high mortality and morbidity
cerebral aneurysm have been postulated to be hormonally influenced
cerebral aneurysm are more prevalent in postmenopausal women
a devastating disease rupture are more prevalent in postmenopausal women
a devastating disease rupture have been postulated to be hormonally influenced
the goal of this study was to investigate the associations of reproductive life span with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in women
the goal of this study was to investigate the associations of age at menarche with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in women
the goal of this study was to investigate the associations of age at menopause with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in women
the goal of this study was to investigate the associations of femalespecific factors with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in women
participants in the nurses health study were followed up from the time of reaching menopause until 2018
participants in the nurses health study were followed up from 1980
only women with surgical menopause due to bilateral oophorectomy were included
only women with natural menopause due to bilateral oophorectomy were included
reproductive life span was defined by subtracting the age at menarche from the age at menopause
multivariablestratified proportional hazards models were used to study age at menopause with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
multivariablestratified proportional hazards models were used to study reproductive life span at menopause with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
multivariablestratified proportional hazards models were used to study age at menarche at menopause with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
multivariable models were adjusted for age race smoking hysterectomy hypertension hyperlipidemia body mass index
multivariable models were adjusted for hormone therapy use
multivariable models were adjusted for oral contraceptive use
multivariable models were adjusted for parity
a shorter reproductive life span was associated with a 2fold higher incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage after multivariable adjustment
early age at menopause was similarly associated with a higher risk of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
age at menarche was not
use of oral contraceptives was not associated with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
use of postmenopausal hormone therapy was not associated with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
a shorter reproductive life span duration were associated with a higher risk of incident aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in women
an earlier age at menopause were associated with a higher risk of incident aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in women
no associations were noted for age at postmenopausal therapy use
no associations were noted for age at parity
no associations were noted for age at menarche
no associations were noted for age at oral contraceptive use
