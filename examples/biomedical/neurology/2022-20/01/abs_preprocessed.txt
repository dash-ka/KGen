this external validation analyzed 210 consecutive patients with available ct from a prospective singlecenter observational cohort study
this external validation analyzed 210 consecutive patients with mri studies from a prospective singlecenter observational cohort study
this external validation analyzed 210 consecutive patients with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage from a prospective singlecenter observational cohort study
we investigated diagnostic accuracy of the simplified edinburgh ctbased criteria for identification of intracerebral hemorrhage
intracerebral hemorrhage associated with probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy according to mribased modified boston criteria as a reference standard
we investigated the interrater variability of the simplified edinburgh ctbased criteria for identification of intracerebral hemorrhage
we evaluated the lowrisk category for ruling out with the assumptions of no patients
we evaluated the utility of the simplified edinburgh ct criteria the simplified edinburgh by decision curve analysis
the assumptions of no patients having cerebral amyloid angiopathy
decision curve analysis comparing the theoretical clinical net benefit of the highrisk category for ruling in
the assumptions of all patients having cerebral amyloid angiopathy
we evaluated the lowrisk category for ruling out with the assumptions of all patients
discrimination was good without evidence of poor calibration for validation of mribased diagnosis of probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy
decision curve analysis suggested a theoretical clinical net benefit for ruling in
decision curve analysis suggested a theoretical clinical net benefit for ruling for ruling out probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy compared to default strategies
applying the simplified edinburgh ct criteria during diagnostic workup seems clinically useful
applying the simplified edinburgh ct criteria during diagnostic workup may accurately identify cerebral amyloid angiopathy in patients with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage
