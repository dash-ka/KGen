In patients with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage, etiologic characterization represents a tradeoff between feasibility, resource allocation, and diagnostic certainty . This study investigated the accuracy and clinical utility of the simplified Edinburgh CT criteria to identify underlying cerebral amyloid angiopathy .

This external validation analyzed 210 consecutive patients with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage and available CT and MRI studies from a prospective single-center observational cohort study . We investigated the interrater variability and diagnostic accuracy of the simplified Edinburgh CT-based criteria for identification of intracerebral hemorrhage associated with probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy according to MRI-based modified Boston criteria as a reference standard . We evaluated the utility of the simplified Edinburgh criteria by decision curve analysis, comparing the theoretical clinical net benefit of the high-risk category for ruling in and the low-risk category for ruling out with the assumptions of no or all patients having cerebral amyloid angiopathy .

Discrimination was good without evidence of poor calibration for validation of MRI-based diagnosis of probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy . Decision curve analysis suggested a theoretical clinical net benefit for ruling in but not for ruling out probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy compared to default strategies .

Applying the simplified Edinburgh CT criteria during diagnostic workup seems clinically useful and may accurately identify cerebral amyloid angiopathy in patients with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage .
