to investigate the association of radiochemotherapyinduced cytopenia with sex in patients with glioma
to investigate the association of the association of radiochemotherapyinduced cytopenia potential effect on survival in patients with glioma
we retrospectively analyzed cytopenia during temozolomidebased concomitant radiochemotherapy in 492 patients with glioma
overall survival were recorded
molecular pathology were recorded
adjuvant chemotherapy subsequent to the radiochemotherapy phase were recorded
histologic grading were recorded
surgical procedures were recorded
the extent of cytopenia was correlated with outcome
the extent of cytopenia was correlated with sex
treatmentinduced severe cytopenia was more frequent in women than men
in women with idhwt highgrade astrocytomas there was a negative correlation of severe cytopenia in general
in women with idhwt highgrade astrocytomas there was a negative correlation of thrombocytopenia in particular during temozolomide radiochemotherapy with overall survival independent from other predictors
in men there was also a trend for this unfavorable effect
in addition severe cytopenia in all blood cell lineages correlated with reduced temozolomide dose exposure during radiochemotherapy
in addition severe cytopenia in all blood cell lineages reduced dose exposure was independently associated with worse overall survival
our analysis of treatmentinduced cytopenia in a large cohort of patients with glioma demonstrates an association of cytopenia with shortened survival in women
our analysis of treatmentinduced cytopenia in a large cohort of patients with glioma confirms that women are at higher risk
