To investigate the association of radiochemotherapy-induced cytopenia with sex and its potential effect on survival in patients with glioma .

We retrospectively analyzed cytopenia during temozolomide-based concomitant radiochemotherapy in 492 patients with glioma . Histologic grading, molecular pathology, surgical procedures, adjuvant chemotherapy subsequent to the radiochemotherapy phase, and overall survival were recorded . The extent of cytopenia was correlated with sex and outcome .

Treatment-induced severe cytopenia was more frequent in women than men . In women with IDH-wt high-grade astrocytomas, there was a negative correlation of severe cytopenia in general and thrombocytopenia in particular during temozolomide radiochemotherapy with overall survival independent from other predictors . In men, there was also a trend for this unfavorable effect . In addition, severe cytopenia in all blood cell lineages correlated with reduced temozolomide dose exposure during radiochemotherapy and reduced dose exposure was independently associated with worse overall survival .

Our analysis of treatment-induced cytopenia in a large cohort of patients with glioma confirms that women are at higher risk and demonstrates an association of cytopenia with shortened survival in women .
