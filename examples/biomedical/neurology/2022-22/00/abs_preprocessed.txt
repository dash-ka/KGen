blood biomarkers may allow earlier identification of disease such as physical functioning
blood biomarkers may allow earlier identification of parkinsonism such as physical functioning
blood biomarkers may allow earlier identification of poor parkinson diseaserelated outcomes such as physical functioning
neurofilament light  is a biomarker of neurodegeneration measurable in biofluids
a neuronal cytoplasmic protein is a biomarker of neurodegeneration measurable in biofluids
our objective was to examine the association of serum neurofilament light at baseline with clinically diagnosed parkinson parkinsonian signs over 16 years in a populationbased sample of older adults
our objective was to examine the association of serum neurofilament light at baseline with clinically diagnosed parkinson physical functioning change over 16 years in a populationbased sample of older adults

clinical evaluations included assessing parkinsonian signs in 4 domains rigidity  using a structured version of the unified parkinson disease rating scale
clinical evaluations included assessing parkinsonian signs in 4 domains bradykinesia  using a structured version of the unified parkinson disease rating scale
clinical evaluations included assessing parkinsonian signs in 4 domains tremors  using a structured version of the unified parkinson disease rating scale
clinical evaluations included assessing parkinsonian signs in 4 domains parkinsonian gait  using a structured version of the unified parkinson disease rating scale
boardcertified neurologists diagnosed disease
physical functioning was assessed using chair stands tandem walk
physical functioning timed walk
an ultrasensitive immunoassay was used to measure the concentration of neurofilament light in blood
physical functioning decline
a higher concentration of serum neurofilament light was associated with a faster rate of physical
in participants with 2fold higher concentrations of serum neurofilament light the annual rate of decline in physical functioning increased by 015 units
serum neurofilament light was associated with incident physical functioning decline in a populationbased sample
serum neurofilament light was associated with incident parkinsonian signs
serum neurofilament light was associated with incident clinical parkinson disease
our findings suggest that neurofilament light may serve as a potential biomarker 
our findings suggest that neurofilament light may serve as parkinson disease outcomes
