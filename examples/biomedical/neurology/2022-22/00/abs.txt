Blood biomarkers may allow earlier identification of Parkinson disease, parkinsonism, and poor Parkinson disease-related outcomes, such as physical functioning . Neurofilament light, a neuronal cytoplasmic protein, is a biomarker of neurodegeneration measurable in biofluids . Our objective was to examine the association of serum Neurofilament light at baseline with clinically diagnosed Parkinson disease, parkinsonian signs, and physical functioning change over 16 years in a population-based sample of older adults .

Data came from 1,327 older participants from the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a longitudinal population-based study . Clinical evaluations included assessing parkinsonian signs in 4 domains—bradykinesia, parkinsonian gait, rigidity, and tremors—using a structured version of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale . Board-certified neurologists diagnosed Parkinson disease . Physical functioning was assessed using chair stands, tandem walk, and timed walk . An ultrasensitive immunoassay was used to measure the concentration of Neurofilament light in blood .

A higher concentration of serum Neurofilament light was associated with a faster rate of physical functioning decline . In participants with 2-fold higher concentrations of serum Neurofilament light, the annual rate of decline in physical functioning increased by 0.15 units .

Serum Neurofilament light was associated with incident clinical Parkinson disease, parkinsonian signs, and physical functioning decline in a population-based sample . Our findings suggest that Neurofilament light may serve as a potential biomarker for neurodegeneration, including Parkinson disease outcomes .
