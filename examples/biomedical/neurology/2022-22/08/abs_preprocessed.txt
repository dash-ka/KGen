serum creatinine is typically used to assess kidney function
impaired kidney function increase the risk of poor cognitive performance
high serum creatinine increase the risk of poor cognitive performance
however serum creatinine might have a nonlinear association because low serum creatinine has been linked to cardiovascular risk
however serum creatinine might have a nonlinear association because low serum creatinine has been linked to impaired cognitive performance
we studied a nonlinear association between serum creatinine in midlife
we studied a nonlinear association between cognitive performance in midlife
since 2001 participants from the cardiovascular risk in young finns study were followed up for 10 years
serum creatinine was measured repeatedly in 2011
serum creatinine was measured repeatedly in 2007
serum creatinine was measured repeatedly in 2001
sexspecific longitudinal trajectories for serum creatinine among participants without kidney disease were identified with latent class growth mixture modeling
overall cognitive function  working episodic memory  were assessed with a computerized cognitive test
4 specific domains  working associative learning  were assessed with a computerized cognitive test
overall cognitive function  working reaction time  were assessed with a computerized cognitive test
4 specific domains  working episodic memory  were assessed with a computerized cognitive test
4 specific domains  working memory  were assessed with a computerized cognitive test
overall cognitive function  working memory  were assessed with a computerized cognitive test
4 specific domains  working reaction time  were assessed with a computerized cognitive test
4 specific domains  working information processing  were assessed with a computerized cognitive test
overall cognitive function  working information processing  were assessed with a computerized cognitive test

in men consistently low serum creatinine was associated with low adulthood annual income
in men consistently low serum creatinine was associated with low physical activity
in women consistently low serum creatinine was associated with low adulthood annual income
in women consistently low serum creatinine was associated with low physical activity
in men consistently low serum creatinine was associated with low adulthood education
in men consistently low serum creatinine was associated with poor childhood school performance
in men consistently low serum creatinine was associated with smoking
in women consistently low serum creatinine was associated with poor childhood school performance
in women consistently low serum creatinine was associated with smoking
in women consistently low serum creatinine was associated with low adulthood education
compared to the men in the low serum creatinine trajectory group those in the high serum creatinine group had better overall cognitive performance while those in normal serum creatinine groups had better episodic memory
compared to the men in the low serum creatinine trajectory group those in the high serum creatinine group had better working memory while those in the moderate had better associative learning

no associations were found for women
our results indicate that in men compared to low serum creatinine levels consistently high levels may be associated with learning function in midlife
our results indicate that in men compared to low serum creatinine levels consistently high levels may be associated with better memory in midlife
