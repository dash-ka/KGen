most primary progressive aphasia literature is based on english language users
logographic writing systems
linguistic features that vary from english
linguistic features such as logographic are underinvestigated
primary progressive aphasia who write in chinese and investigated patients diagnostic utility in classifying primary progressive aphasia variants
the current study characterized the dysgraphia phenotypes of patients with primary progressive aphasia
the current study recruited 40 participants with primary progressive aphasia from san francisco
the current study recruited 40 participants with primary progressive aphasia from hong kong
the current study recruited 40 participants with 20 cognitively normal participants from san francisco
the current study recruited 40 participants with 20 cognitively normal participants from hong kong
the current study recruited 40 participants with 20 cognitively normal participants from taiwan
the current study recruited 40 participants with primary progressive aphasia from taiwan
we examined the occurrence of various writing errors across the study groups
we measured dictation accuracy using the chinese language assessment for primary progressive aphasia 60character orthographic dictation test
we also performed voxelbased morphometry analysis to identify the gray matter regions correlated with dictation accuracy and prevalence of writing errors
individuals with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia frequently presented with phonologically plausible errors at lexical level patients with logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia showed higher preponderance towards visual errors
individuals with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia frequently presented with phonologically plausible errors at lexical level patients with logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia showed higher preponderance towards stroke errors
patients with nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia commonly exhibited compound word
patients with agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia commonly exhibited radical errors
patients with nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia commonly exhibited radical errors
patients with agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia commonly exhibited compound word
the prevalence of phonologically plausible compound word errors was negatively correlated with cortical volume over the bilateral temporal regions left bilateral orbitofrontal gyri respectively
the prevalence of phonologically plausible visual was negatively correlated with cortical volume over the bilateral temporal regions left temporooccipital area respectively
the prevalence of phonologically plausible compound word errors was negatively correlated with cortical volume over the bilateral temporal regions left temporooccipital area respectively
the prevalence of phonologically plausible visual was negatively correlated with cortical volume over the bilateral temporal regions left bilateral orbitofrontal gyri respectively
the findings demonstrate the potential role of primary progressive aphasia classification indicator in chinese language users
the findings demonstrate the potential role of the orthographic dictation task as a screening tool in chinese language users
specific chinese dysgraphia phenotypes that vary from those previously reported in englishspeaking patients with primary progressive aphasia highlighting the importance of language diversity in primary progressive aphasia
each primary progressive aphasia variant had specific chinese dysgraphia phenotypes
