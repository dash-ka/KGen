neurocognitive outcomes after surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy in childhood are variable
postoperative changes are not directly predicted by seizure freedom
associations between epilepsy neuropsychological function and developing neural networks are poorly understood
here we leveraged wholebrain connectomic profiling in magnetoencephalography to retrospectively study neuropsychological function in children with temporal lobe epilepsy
here we leveraged wholebrain connectomic profiling in magnetoencephalography to retrospectively study associations between brain connectivity with temporal lobe epilepsy
temporal lobe epilepsy undergoing resective surgery
magnetoencephalography data were retrospectively analyzed for children
children who underwent temporal lobe epilepsy surgery at the hospital for sick children from 2000 to 2021
clinical data were retrospectively analyzed for children
restingstate connectomes were constructed from neuromagnetic oscillations via the weightedphase lag index
using a partial leastsquares approach we assessed multidimensional associations between clinical covariates
using a partial leastsquares approach we assessed multidimensional associations between neuropsychological scores
using a partial leastsquares approach we assessed multidimensional associations between patient connectomes
bootstrap were performed to assess statistical significance
bootstrap resampling statistics
clinical covariates which included changes in verbal memory overall intellectual function
clinical covariates which included changes in narrative overall intellectual function
in each partial leastsquares analysis a significant latent variable was identified relating neural networks to clinical covariates
clinical covariates which included changes in rote verbal memory working memory
clinical covariates which included changes in rote verbal memory visual memory
clinical covariates which included changes in narrative visual memory
clinical covariates which included changes in narrative working memory
clinical covariates which included changes in verbal memory visual memory
clinical covariates which included changes in verbal memory working memory
clinical covariates which included changes in rote verbal memory overall intellectual function
in each partial leastsquares analysis a significant latent variable was identified representing a specific percentage of the variance in the data
children with more diffuse bilateral intrinsic connectivity across several frequency bands showed lower scores on all neuropsychological assessments
children with more diffuse bilateral intrinsic connectivity across several frequency bands demonstrated a greater propensity for gains after resective surgery
here we report that connectomes are associated with postoperative cognitive improvement
connectomes characterized by diffuse connectivity reminiscent of developmentally immature networks
here we report that connectomes are associated with lower preoperative cognition
these findings provide a potential means to understand neurocognitive function in children with temporal lobe epilepsy
these findings provide a potential means to understand neurocognitive function in expected changes postoperatively
