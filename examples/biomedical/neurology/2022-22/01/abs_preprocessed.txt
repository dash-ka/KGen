there is guiding concept for the treating clinician
there is therapeutic trial outcome measure for patients with parkinson disease
there is growing interest in healthrelated quality of life as a comprehensive view of the patients wellbeing
the key determinants of healthrelated quality of life have not been investigated in large populations of patients with parkinson disease
our objective was to evaluate correlates of healthrelated quality of life in a large online cohort of patients with parkinson disease
as part of an ongoing online cohort study our performed a crosssectional analysis at enrollment of 23058 patients with parkinson disease
our conducted univariate multivariate linear regression analyses of healthrelated quality of life as measured by the eq5d5l tool
our conducted stepwise multivariate linear regression analyses of healthrelated quality of life as measured by the eq5d5l tool
in addition our performed an interaction analysis to evaluate heterogeneity of the effect of motor symptoms on healthrelated quality of life correlation analysis to evaluate the association of nonmotor symptoms with healthrelated quality of life
in addition our performed an interaction analysis to evaluate heterogeneity of the effect of motor symptoms on healthrelated quality of spearman correlation analysis to evaluate the association of nonmotor symptoms with healthrelated quality of life
in the multivariate linear regression model participants with severe depression had the most substantially decreased healthrelated quality of life as measured by the eq index
in the multivariate linear regression model participants with a higher burden of medical comorbidities had the most substantially decreased healthrelated quality of life as measured by the eq index
in the multivariate linear regression model participants with more severe motor symptoms had the most substantially decreased healthrelated quality of life as measured by the eq index
in the multivariate linear regression model participants with moderate depression had the most substantially decreased healthrelated quality of life as measured by the eq index
an interaction analysis showed that more severe motor symptoms had a higher effect on individuals with female sex lower educational level lower income
an interaction analysis showed that more severe motor symptoms had a higher effect on individuals with more severe depression
an interaction analysis showed that more severe motor symptoms had a higher effect on individuals with more severe cognitive impairment
falls had the most negative associations with healthrelated quality of life
neuropsychiatric symptoms had the most negative associations with healthrelated quality of life
nonmotor symptoms particularly neuropsychiatric symptoms account for a large amount of the variation in healthrelated quality of life in patients with parkinson disease
potentially treatable motor account for a large amount of the variation in healthrelated quality of life in patients with parkinson disease
motor symptoms may have differential effects on healthrelated quality of life in clinical subpopulations highlighting important areas for future health disparities research
motor symptoms may have differential effects on healthrelated quality of life in different demographic highlighting important areas for future health disparities research
our findings provide targets for clinician intervention to optimize healthrelated quality of life in parkinson disease
our findings provide future research on symptom management to optimize healthrelated quality of life in parkinson disease
