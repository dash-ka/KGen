these individuals are increasingly being enrolled in clinical treatment trials
there is a need to identify markers to predict which of these individuals will also develop tau deposition
characteristics that could distinguish between those
those who develop high tau within this period
characteristics that could distinguish between these individuals
we aimed to determine whether betaamyloidpositive individuals can identify characteristics
we aimed to determine whether betaamyloidpositive individuals can remain taunegative for at least 5 years
logtransformed standard uptake value ratio values from 7 medial parietal regions using all participants in the alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative with flortaucipir pet
tau pet positivity was defined using a gaussian mixture model with logtransformed standard uptake value ratio values from 7 temporal parietal regions
tau pet positivity was defined using a gaussian mixture model with logtransformed standard uptake value ratio values from 7 medial parietal regions
logtransformed standard uptake value ratio values from 7 temporal parietal regions using all participants in the alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative with flortaucipir pet
tau pet scans were classified as normal if the posterior probability of elevated tau was less than 1 perent
betaamyloid pet positivity was defined based on adalzheimer disease
adalzheimer disease neuroimaging initiativeni cutpoints
alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative who had all betaamyloidpositive individuals with abnormal tau pet within 5 years
alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative who had normal tau pet more than 5 years after all betaamyloidpositive individuals first abnormal betaamyloid pet within 5 years
we identified all betaamyloidpositive individuals from alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative
in a casecontrol design logistic regression was used to model the odds of biomarker alzheimer disease versus low tau accounting for apoe epsilon4 carriership
in a casecontrol design logistic regression was used to model the odds of biomarker alzheimer disease versus low tau accounting for sex
in a casecontrol design logistic regression was used to model the odds of biomarker alzheimer disease versus low tau accounting for betaamyloid centiloid
in a casecontrol design logistic regression was used to model the odds of biomarker alzheimer disease versus low tau accounting for hippocampal volume
in a casecontrol design logistic regression was used to model the odds of biomarker alzheimer disease versus low tau accounting for age
hippocampal atrophy were independently associated with increased odds of abnormal tau within 5 years
apoe epsilon4 were independently associated with increased odds of abnormal tau within 5 years
higher betaamyloid centiloid were independently associated with increased odds of abnormal tau within 5 years
a centiloid value of 50 effectively discriminated biomarker alzheimer disease with 80 percent sensitivity
a centiloid value of 50 effectively discriminated biomarker alzheimer disease with specificity
a centiloid value of 50 effectively discriminated low tau with 80 percent sensitivity
a centiloid value of 50 effectively discriminated low tau with specificity
the majority of the low tau participants did not develop dementia throughout the 5year interval
betaamyloidpositive individuals can remain taunegative for at least 5 years
baseline characteristics can help identify these low tau individuals
these low tau individuals who are less likely to develop dementia
conservative betaamyloid cutpoints should be utilized for clinical trials to better capture individuals with high risk of developing biomarker alzheimer disease
