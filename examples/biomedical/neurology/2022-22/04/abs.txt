The aim of this work was to test the accuracy of Persyst commercially available automated seizure detection in critical care EEG by comparing automated seizure detections to human review in a manually reviewed cohort and on a large scale .

Automated seizure detections were compared to human review in a pilot cohort of 229 seizures from 85 EEG records and then in an expanded cohort of 7,924 EEG records . Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated for individual seizures and for entire records . We assessed EEG features associated with the accuracy of automated seizure detections .

In the pilot cohort, accuracy of automated detection for individual seizures was modest . At the record level, sensitivity was higher, positive predictive value was low, and negative predictive value was high . Different software versions performed similarly . Sensitivity was higher for records containing focal-onset seizures compared to generalized-onset seizures .

In critical care continuous EEG recordings, automated detection of individual seizures had rates of both false negatives and false positives that bring into question its utility as a seizure alarm in clinical practice . At the level of entire EEG records, the absence of automated detections accurately predicted EEG records without true seizures . The true value of Persyst automated seizure detection appears to lie in triaging of low-risk EEGs .
