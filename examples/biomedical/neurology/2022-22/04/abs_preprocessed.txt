the aim of this work was to test the accuracy of persyst commercially available automated seizure detection in critical care eeg by comparing automated seizure detections to human review in a manually reviewed cohort
automated seizure detections were compared in an expanded cohort of 7924 eeg records
automated seizure detections were compared to human review in a pilot cohort of 229 seizures from 85 eeg records
negative predictive value were calculated for individual seizures
sensitivity were calculated for entire records
sensitivity were calculated for individual seizures
positive predictive value were calculated for individual seizures
specificity were calculated for individual seizures
positive predictive value were calculated for entire records
specificity were calculated for entire records
negative predictive value were calculated for entire records
features associated with the accuracy of automated seizure detections
we assessed eeg features
in the pilot cohort accuracy of automated detection for individual seizures was modest
at the record level sensitivity was higher positive predictive value was low and negative predictive value was high
different software versions performed similarly
sensitivity was higher for records
records containing focalonset seizures compared to generalizedonset seizures
in critical care continuous eeg recordings automated detection of individual seizures had rates of both false negatives
in critical care continuous eeg recordings automated detection of individual seizures had rates of false positives
both false negatives that bring into question automated detection of individual seizures utility as a seizure alarm in clinical practice
false positives that bring into question automated detection of individual seizures utility as a seizure alarm in clinical practice
at the level of entire eeg records the absence of automated detections accurately predicted eeg records without true seizures
the true value of persyst automated seizure detection appears to lie in triaging of lowrisk eegs
