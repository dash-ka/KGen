cingulate epilepsy is a rare type of focal epilepsy
focal epilepsy that is challenging to diagnose because of the polymorphic semiology of the seizures mimicking the limited utility of scalp eeg
focal epilepsy that is challenging to diagnose because of the polymorphic semiology of the seizures mimicking other types of epilepsy
we selected consecutive patients with drugresistant cingulate epilepsy
drugresistant cingulate epilepsy who were seizurefree after surgery with seizure onset zone confirmed in the cingulate cortex by histology eeg
drugresistant cingulate epilepsy who were seizurefree after surgery with seizure onset zone confirmed in the cingulate cortex by stereo eeg
we analyzed objective ictal manifestations using video recordings
we correlated semiology with anatomical cingulate cortex subregion localization of seizure onset zone
we analyzed subjective ictal manifestations using video recordings
seizures were globally often accompanied by emotional components
seizures were globally characterized by complex behaviors typically natural seeming
all objective ictal variables considered
all objective ictal variables were differently distributed among cingulate cortex subregions

somatosensory were distributed differently among cingulate cortex subregions
epigastric were distributed differently among cingulate cortex subregions
asymmetric somatosensory were distributed differently among cingulate cortex subregions
autonomic symptoms were distributed differently among cingulate cortex subregions
enteroceptive symptoms were distributed differently among cingulate cortex subregions
vestibular somatosensory were distributed differently among cingulate cortex subregions
along the rostrocaudal axis vestibular somatosensory asymmetric symptoms increased anteriorposteriorly
along the rostrocaudal axis somatosensory asymmetric symptoms increased anteriorposteriorly
cingulate epilepsy is characterized by a spectrum of semiologic manifestations with a topographic distribution
cingulate epilepsy semiology could indicate which cingulate sector is primarily involved
