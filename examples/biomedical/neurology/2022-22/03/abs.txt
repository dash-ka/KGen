Cingulate epilepsy is a rare type of focal epilepsy that is challenging to diagnose because of the polymorphic semiology of the seizures, mimicking other types of epilepsy, and the limited utility of scalp EEG .

We selected consecutive patients with drug-resistant Cingulate epilepsy who were seizure-free after surgery, with seizure onset zone confirmed in the cingulate cortex by histology or stereo EEG . We analyzed subjective and objective ictal manifestations using video recordings and correlated semiology with anatomical cingulate cortex subregion localization of seizure onset zone .

Seizures were globally characterized by complex behaviors, typically natural seeming and often accompanied by emotional components . All objective ictal variables considered were differently distributed among cingulate cortex subregions . Along the rostro-caudal axis, fluidity and repetitiveness of movement, vocalizations, body pronation, and emotional components decreased anterior–posteriorly, whereas tonic and dystonic postures, signs of lateralization, and awareness increased . Vestibular and asymmetric somatosensory, somatosensory, and epigastric and enteroceptive and autonomic symptoms were distributed differently among cingulate cortex subregions . Along the rostro-caudal axis, vestibular, somatosensory, and somatosensory asymmetric symptoms increased anterior–posteriorly .

Cingulate epilepsy is characterized by a spectrum of semiologic manifestations with a topographic distribution . Cingulate epilepsy semiology could indicate which cingulate sector is primarily involved .
