relative to the pediatric population there is limited information about dravet syndrome in adults
in addition to some of the gait abnormalities adults with this condition have other gait
the gait abnormalities reported in children with dravet syndrome
in addition to some of the gait abnormalities adults with this condition have motor disturbances
our primary objective was to examine gait manifestations in adults with dravet syndrome
our primary objective was to examine motor manifestations in adults with dravet syndrome
a prospective arm where 6 patients were again in the 2019
a prospective arm where 6 patients were examined through a modified version of the unified parkinson disease rating scale in 2014
our primary objective includes a prospective arm
modified unified parkinson disease rating scale scores were assigned to gait
tremors facial expression arising from posture
tremors facial expression arising from body bradykinesia
tremors facial expression arising from a chair
unified parkinson disease rating scale scores were assigned to gait resting tremors facial expression
a prospective arm where 6 patients were examined through a modified version of the unified parkinson disease rating scale in 2014
patients who were not evaluated in an instrumental gait analysis
a prospective arm includes modified unified parkinson disease rating scale testing in patients
a prospective arm where 6 patients were again in 2019
patients who were not evaluated in 2014
a prospective arm where 6 patients were again in 2019
a prospective arm were done in the 2019 to 2020 period
a prospective arm where 6 patients were examined through a modified version of the unified parkinson disease rating scale in 2014
a gait mat built with sensors capturing the sagittal planes
the instrumental gait analysis was performed using protokinetics software with a gait mat
a gait mat built with sensors capturing the coronal planes
a gait mat built with 2 cameras capturing the sagittal planes
a gait mat built with 2 cameras capturing the coronal planes
the instrumental gait analysis was performed in a group of 17 patients with dravet syndrome
regression analyses were performed for the instrumental gait analysis
regression analyses were performed for modified unified parkinson disease rating scale data
the crosssectional analysis of modified unified parkinson disease rating scale in a larger group of adults showed that worse scores for arising from gait were positively associated with age
the crosssectional analysis of modified unified parkinson disease rating scale in a larger group of adults showed that worse scores for arising from a chair were positively associated with age
the crosssectional analysis of modified unified parkinson disease rating scale in a larger group of adults showed that worse scores for arising from body bradykinesia were positively associated with age
the instrumental gait analysis crosssectional arm revealed that all 17 adults with dravet syndrome had abnormal gait measures in all domains
all domains tested
a group of 17 patients with dravet syndrome performed worse than the healthy control group
a group of 17 patients with dravet syndrome performed worse than the older control group
although seizures may decrease in older adults with dravet syndrome this prospective study showed that a group of 17 patients with gait become progressively worse as a group of 17 patients with dravet syndrome age
although seizures may decrease in older adults with dravet syndrome this prospective study showed that a group of 17 patients with dravet syndrome motor symptoms become progressively worse as a group of 17 patients with dravet syndrome age
