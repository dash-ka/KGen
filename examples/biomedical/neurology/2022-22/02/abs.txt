Relative to the pediatric population, there is limited information about Dravet syndrome in adults . In addition to some of the gait abnormalities reported in children with Dravet syndrome, adults with this condition have other gait and motor disturbances . Our primary objective was to examine gait and motor manifestations in adults with Dravet syndrome .

This study includes a prospective arm where 6 patients were examined through a modified version of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale in 2014 and again in 2019 . modified Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores were assigned to gait, resting tremors, facial expression, arising from a chair, posture, and body bradykinesia . The cross-sectional arm includes modified Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale testing in patients who were not evaluated in 2014 and an instrumental gait analysis . These cross-sectional tests were done in the 2019 to 2020 period . The instrumental gait analysis was performed using ProtoKinetics software with a gait mat built with sensors and 2 cameras capturing the sagittal and coronal planes . The instrumental gait analysis was performed in a group of 17 patients with Dravet syndrome . Regression analyses were performed for the instrumental gait analysis and modified Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale data .

The cross-sectional analysis of modified Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale in a larger group of adults showed that worse scores for arising from a chair, body bradykinesia, and gait were positively associated with age . The instrumental gait analysis cross-sectional arm revealed that all 17 adults with Dravet syndrome had abnormal gait measures in all domains tested . This group of patients performed worse than the healthy and older control group .

Although seizures may decrease in older adults with Dravet syndrome, this prospective and cross-sectional study showed that their motor symptoms and gait become progressively worse as they age .
