human genetic studies support a key role of interleukin6 in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke
however there are only limited data from observational studies exploring circulating interleukin6 levels as a risk factor for ischemic stroke
we set out to perform a systematic review and metaanalysis of aggregate data on cohort studies to determine the magnitude and shape of the association between circulating interleukin6 levels and risk of incident ischemic stroke in the general population
populationbased prospective cohort studies exploring the association between circulating interleukin6 levels and risk of incident ischemic stroke
following the prisma guidelines we systematically screened the pubmed search engine from inception to march 2021 for populationbased prospective cohort studies
we explored nonlinear effects in doseresponse metaanalyses
we pooled association estimates for ischemic stroke risk with randomeffects models
risk of bias was assessed with the newcastleottawa scale
we used funnel trimtofill analyses to assess publication bias
we used funnel plots to assess publication bias
we identified 11 studies meeting we eligibility criteria
mean age of all included participants was 605 years
mean age of all included 548 percent were female
overall quality of the included studies was high
in metaanalyses 1 standard deviation increment in circulating logtransformed interleukin6 levels was associated with a 19 percent increase in risk of incident ischemic stroke over a mean followup of 124 years
a doseresponse metaanalysis showed a linear association between circulating interleukin6 levels
a doseresponse metaanalysis showed a linear association between circulating ischemic stroke risk
there was only moderate heterogeneity
the results were consistent in sensitivity analyses restricted to studies of low risk of bias fully adjusting for vascular risk factors
the results were consistent in sensitivity analyses restricted to studies of low risk of bias fully adjusting for demographic risk factors
the results were consistent in sensitivity analyses restricted to studies of low risk of studies fully adjusting for vascular risk factors
the results were consistent in sensitivity analyses restricted to studies of low risk of studies fully adjusting for demographic risk factors
the results also remained stable following adjustment for publication bias
higher are associated with higher longterm risk of incident ischemic stroke in a linear pattern factors
higher circulating interleukin6 levels in communitydwelling individuals
higher are associated with higher longterm risk of independently of conventional vascular risk factors
along with findings from clinical trials the results provide additional support for a key role of interleukin6 signaling in ischemic stroke
