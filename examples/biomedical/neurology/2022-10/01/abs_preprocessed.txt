using data from the multicenter randomized clinical trial of endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke in the netherlands registry we compared patients with active cancer to patients without cancer
outcomes were recurrent stroke
outcomes were 90day modified rankin scale score mortality successful reperfusion
outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage
subgroup analyses were according to treatment setting
a prestroke modified rankin scale score of 0
subgroup analyses were performed in patients with a prestroke
a prestroke modified rankin scale score of 1
analyses were adjusted for prognostic variables
of 2583 patients 124 had active cancer
2583 patients who underwent endovascular treatment
124 more often had prestroke disability
the treatment setting was palliative in 253 percent of the patients
there was a shift toward worse functional outcome at 90 days in patients with active cancer
at 90 days patients with active cancer were more often dead
at 90 days patients with active cancer were less often independent
successful reperfusion did not differ
symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates did not differ
recurrent stroke within 90 days was more common in patients with active cancer
the sensitivity analysis of patients with a prestroke showed that patients with active cancer still had a worse outcome at 90 days
a prestroke modified rankin scale score of 1
a prestroke modified rankin scale score of 0
mortality was higher
patients with active cancer in a palliative treatment setting regained functional independence less often compared to patients in a curative setting
despite similar technical success the patients had significantly worse outcomes after endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke
moreover the patients had an increased risk of recurrent stroke
nevertheless
about a quarter of the patients regained functional independence
an increased risk of recurrent stroke was not increased
active cancer undergoing endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke
this study provides class i evidence that patients with active cancer have worse functional outcomes at 90 days compared to those without active cancer
