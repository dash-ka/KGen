little is known of the functional potential of the gut microbiome in pediatriconset multiple sclerosis
we performed metagenomic analyses using stool samples from individuals with pediatriconset multiple sclerosis controls
we performed metagenomic analyses using stool samples from individuals with pediatriconset unaffected controls
21 years old enrolled in the canadian pediatric demyelinating disease network providing a stool sample
persons over 21 years old were eligible
twenty patients with multiple sclerosis with symptom onset smaller than 18 years were matched to 20 controls by sex
twenty patients with multiple sclerosis with symptom onset smaller than 18 years were matched to 20 controls by age
twenty patients with multiple sclerosis with symptom onset smaller than 18 years were matched to 20 controls by stool consistency
twenty patients with multiple sclerosis with symptom onset smaller than 18 years were matched to 20 controls by race
microbial functional potentials were compared by disease status
diseasemodifying drug exposure using relative abundance
prevalence using fisher exact tests respectively
disease status using alpha diversity
microbial taxonomy potentials were compared by diseasemodifying drug exposure
prevalence using wilcoxon rank sum
microbial taxonomy potentials were estimated from stool samplederived metagenomic reads
prevalence using aldex2
diseasemodifying drug exposure using prevalence
microbial functional potentials were compared by diseasemodifying drug exposure
microbial taxonomy potentials were compared by disease status
disease status using relative abundance
microbial functional potentials were estimated from stool samplederived metagenomic reads
disease status using prevalence
diseasemodifying drug exposure using alpha diversity
individuals with multiple sclerosis were aged 136 years at symptom onset were diseasemodifying drugnaive
individuals with multiple sclerosis were aged 136 years at 8 were diseasemodifying drugnaive
mean ages at stool sample were 161 for multiple sclerosis
mean ages at stool sample were 154 years for control participants
alpha diversity of proteins did not differ by diseasemodifying drug status
alpha diversity of proteins did not differ by disease drug status
metabolic pathways did
alpha diversity of enzymes did not differ by diseasemodifying drug status
microbial taxonomy did
alpha diversity of enzymes did not differ by disease drug status
gene annotations did
individuals with multiple sclerosis exhibited higher methanogenesis prevalence but lower homolactic fermentation abundance
individuals with multiple sclerosis exhibited methanobrevibacter abundance but lower homolactic fermentation abundance
differences by diseasemodifying drug status included lower phosphate butyryl transferase for diseasemodifying drugnaive
differences by diseasemodifying drug status included lower phosphate butyryl transferase for diseasemodifying exposed patients with multiple sclerosis
the gut microbiome in pediatriconset multiple sclerosis functional potential and taxonomy differed between individuals with controls including higher prevalence of a methaneproducing pathway from archaea
the gut microbiome in pediatriconset multiple sclerosis functional potential and taxonomy differed between individuals with controls including higher prevalence of depletion of the lactate fermentation pathway
the gut microbiome in pediatriconset multiple sclerosis functional potential and taxonomy differed between individuals with pediatriconset multiple sclerosis including higher prevalence of a methaneproducing pathway from archaea
the gut microbiome in pediatriconset multiple sclerosis functional potential and taxonomy differed between individuals with pediatriconset multiple sclerosis including higher prevalence of depletion of the lactate fermentation pathway
diseasemodifying drug exposure was associated with butyrateproducing enzyme enrichment
together these findings indicate that the gut microbiome of individuals with multiple sclerosis may have a disturbed functional potential
