although flavonoids have the potential to exert neuroprotective benefits evidence of flavonoids role in improving survival rates among individuals with parkinson disease remains lacking
parkinson disease identified from 2 large ongoing cohorts of us men and women
we aimed to prospectively study risk of mortality among individuals with parkinson disease
we aimed to prospectively study the association between prediagnosis flavonoid intakes among individuals with parkinson disease
we aimed to prospectively study the association between postdiagnosis flavonoid intakes among individuals with parkinson disease
included in the current analysis were 652 men from the health professionals followup study
the health professionals followup study who were newly diagnosed with parkinson disease during followup
included in the current analysis were 599 women from the nurses health study
dietary intakes of total flavonoid together with major flavonoidrich foods were repeatedly assessed with a
dietary intakes of parkinson disease subclasses together with major flavonoidrich foods were repeatedly assessed with a
a validated food frequency questionnaire every 4 years
mortality was ascertained via the national death index
mortality was state vital statistics records
we documented 944 deaths during 32 to 34 years of followup
a higher total flavonoid intake before parkinson disease diagnosis was associated in women after adjustment for smoking status
a higher total flavonoid intake before parkinson disease diagnosis was associated with a lower future risk for allbecause mortality in men after adjustment for total energy intake
a higher total flavonoid intake before parkinson disease diagnosis was associated with a lower future risk for allbecause mortality in men after adjustment for other covariates
a higher total flavonoid intake before parkinson disease diagnosis was associated in women after adjustment for total energy intake
a higher total flavonoid intake before parkinson disease diagnosis was associated with a lower future risk for allbecause mortality in men after adjustment for smoking status
a higher total flavonoid intake before parkinson disease diagnosis was associated with a lower future risk for allbecause mortality in men after adjustment for age
a higher total flavonoid intake before parkinson disease diagnosis was associated in women after adjustment for other covariates
a higher total flavonoid intake before parkinson disease diagnosis was associated in women after adjustment for age
the pooled hazard ratio comparing the extreme quartiles
the pooled hazard ratio was 070 with significant heterogeneity
for flavonoid subclasses the highest quartile of anthocyanins had a lower mortality risk compared to the lowest quartile
for flavonoid subclasses the highest quartile of flavan3ols intakes before diagnosis had a lower mortality risk compared to the lowest quartile
for flavonoid subclasses the highest quartile of flavones had a lower mortality risk compared to the lowest quartile
participants consuming over 3 servings per week
for red wine participants had a lower risk compared to less then 1 serving per month
for berries participants had a lower risk compared to less then 1 serving per month
anthocyanins
flavonols
after parkinson disease diagnosis greater consumptions of total flavonoid berries were associated with lower mortality risk
after parkinson disease diagnosis greater consumptions of total flavonoid subclasses were associated with lower mortality risk
polymers
after parkinson disease diagnosis greater consumptions of total flavonoid were associated with lower mortality risk
after parkinson disease diagnosis greater consumptions of total flavonoid red wine were associated with lower mortality risk
flavan3ols
subclasses
among individuals with parkinson disease higher consumption of flavonoids was likely to be associated with a lower risk of mortality
among individuals with parkinson disease higher consumption of flavonoidrich food such as berries was likely to be associated with a lower risk of mortality
among individuals with parkinson disease higher consumption of especially anthocyanins and flavan3ols was likely to be associated with a lower risk of mortality
among individuals with parkinson disease higher consumption of flavonoidrich food such as red wine was likely to be associated with a lower risk of mortality
