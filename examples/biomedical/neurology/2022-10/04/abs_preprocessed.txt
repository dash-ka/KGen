the clinical factors associated with early late
to determine the sociodemographic factors during the first year after a stroke
to determine persistent clinically significant symptoms of depression during the first year after a stroke
the sociodemographic factors associated with early late
to determine the clinical factors during the first year after a stroke
1221 men and women recruited within 2 weeks of stroke onset in new zealand
1221 men and women recruited within 2 weeks of stroke onset in vietnam
this cohort study included 1221 men and women
1221 men and women recruited within 2 weeks of stroke onset in australia
the nih stroke scale was used to assess stroke severity
other study measures included age sex marital status living arrangements function before the stroke depression before the stroke modified the nih stroke scale score
other study measures included treatment with placebo for 26 weeks
other study measures included treatment with fluoxetine for 26 weeks
the presence of depression was defined by pharmacologic treatment of depression during followup
the presence of depression was defined by psychological treatment of depression during followup
the presence of depression was defined by a total patient health questionnaire score greater than 9 during followup
the presence of depression was defined by a clinician diagnosis of depression between assessments during followup
clinically significant symptoms of depression during the 52 weeks after baseline was the outcome of interest
participants were classified as not depressed or as having early late or persistent depression
we used multinomial logistic regression to assess depression risk with all listed measures entered simultaneously into the model
775 were male
the mean age of participants was 638 years
at baseline
48 participants had previous
228 had clinically significant symptoms of depression
previous treated depression
seven hundred thirtyfour participants showed no evidence of depression in the year after the stroke
208 patients had early 86 had late and 131 had persistent depression
increased stroke severity as measured by doubling of the nih stroke scale scores was associated with late
increased stroke severity as measured by doubling of the nih stroke scale scores was associated with persistent clinically significant symptoms of depression
increased stroke severity as measured by doubling of the nih stroke scale scores was associated with an increased risk of early
the modified the nih stroke scale a measure of functional disability
similar findings were apparent for the
past depression was associated with increased risk of persistent clinically significant symptoms of depression as was being married
past depression was associated with increased risk of persistent clinically significant symptoms of depression as was being partnered
the risk of clinically significant symptoms of depression was higher in new zealand than in vietnam
the risk of clinically significant symptoms of depression was higher in australia zealand than in vietnam
the severity of functional deficits increases the risk of poststroke clinically significant symptoms of depression early and persistently
the severity of neurologic deficits increases the risk of poststroke clinically significant symptoms of depression early and persistently
depression before cultural context contribute to mediate depression risk
depression before personal relationships contribute to mediate depression risk
depression before stroke contribute to mediate depression risk
interventions should decrease the risk of poststroke clinically significant symptoms of depression
interventions that minimize the severity of neurologic deficits
interventions that minimize the severity of functional deficits
