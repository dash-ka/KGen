outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage
subgroup analyses were according to treatment setting
a prestroke modified rankin scale score of 0
subgroup analyses were performed in patients with a prestroke
a prestroke modified rankin scale score of 1
analyses were adjusted for prognostic variables
of 2583 patients 124 had active cancer
2583 patients who underwent endovascular treatment
124 more often had prestroke disability
the treatment setting was palliative in 253 percent of the patients
there was a shift toward worse functional outcome at 90 days in patients with active cancer
at 90 days patients with active cancer were more often dead
at 90 days patients with active cancer were less often independent

the sensitivity analysis of patients with a prestroke showed that patients with active cancer still had a worse outcome at 90 days
a prestroke modified rankin scale score of 1
a prestroke modified rankin scale score of 0
mortality was higher
patients with active cancer in a palliative treatment setting regained functional independence less often compared to patients in a curative setting
