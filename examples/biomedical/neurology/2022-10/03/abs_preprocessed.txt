to study the relationship between the presence of cerebral microbleeds among patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage
to study the relationship between the presence of acute hematoma characteristics among patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage
we pooled individual patient data from the antihypertensive treatment of acute cerebral hemorrhage 2 trial
we pooled individual patient data from the minimally invasive surgery plus alteplase for intracerebral hemorrhage evacuation phase 3 trial
we included individuals with a brain mri scan
exposure was the presence of a cerebral microbleed
the coprimary outcomes were admission intracerebral hemorrhage volume
the coprimary outcomes were admission hematoma expansion
demographics considered the study cohort
mixedeffects linear regression models were used with demographics
mixedeffects logistic regression models were used with demographics
comorbid conditions considered fixed effects
mixedeffects linear regression models were used with comorbid conditions
demographics considered fixed effects
the study cohort treated as a random effect
comorbid conditions considered the study cohort
mixedeffects logistic regression models were used with comorbid conditions
additional analyses assessed the relationship between cerebral microbleed topography
additional analyses assessed the relationship between hematoma characteristics
additional analyses assessed the relationship between number
466 were included in this analysis
of the 1499 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage
231 patients had cerebral microbleeds
intracerebral hemorrhage enrolled in the parent trials
in adjusted models presence of cerebral microbleeds was associated with smaller intracerebral hemorrhage volume
in adjusted models presence of cerebral microbleeds was associated with lower odds of hematoma expansion
the strength of association between hematoma characteristics increased with increasing number of cerebral microbleeds
the strength of association between cerebral microbleeds increased with increasing number of cerebral microbleeds
the location of the severity of leukoaraiosis did not modify these results
the location of the cerebral microbleeds did not modify these results
in a pooled cohort of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage our results are consistent with the hypothesis that more severe underlying small vessel disease as represented by cerebral microbleeds leads to smaller baseline hematoma volumes
in a pooled cohort of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage our results are consistent with the hypothesis that more severe underlying small vessel disease as represented by cerebral microbleeds leads to reduced hematoma expansion
underlying cerebral small vessel disease may be of prognostic significance after intracerebral hemorrhage
this study provides class ii evidence that the presence of microbleeds on mri is associated with a lower rate of hematoma expansion on followup imaging
this study provides class ii evidence that the presence of microbleeds on mri is associated with a smaller intracerebral hemorrhage volume at presentation on followup imaging
