The goal of this work was to determine whether midlife Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adultsc structure and function and their 25-year change from early to middle adulthood are associated with lower midlife cognition .

We studied 2,653 participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study . Echocardiograms were obtained at year 5, 25, and 30 visits to assess left ventricular mass, left ventricular systolic function with left ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular diastolic function with left atrial volume and early peak mitral velocity over early peak mitral annular velocity ratio. left ventricular mass and left atrial volume were indexed to body surface area . At year 30, 5 cognitive domains were measured: global cognition, processing speed, executive function, delayed verbal memory, and verbal fluency . We investigated the association between midlife and 25-year change cardiac structure and function on midlife cognition using linear regressions .



Midlife cardiac structure and its change from early to middle adulthood are associated with lower midlife cognition even after accounting for confounders . Unlike systolic function, midlife left ventricular diastolic function and its 25-year change were also linked to cognition . Our results provide information linking early to midlife cardiac structure and function to cognition .
