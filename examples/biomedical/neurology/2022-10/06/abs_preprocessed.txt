the goal of this work was to determine whether midlife coronary artery risk development in young adultsc structure and function are associated with lower midlife cognition
the goal of this work was to determine whether young adultsc 25year change from early to middle adulthood are associated with lower midlife cognition
we studied 2653 participants from the coronary artery risk development in young adults study
echocardiograms were obtained at 25 to assess left ventricular mass left ventricular systolic function with left ventricular ejection fraction mitral velocity over early peak mitral annular velocity ratio
echocardiograms were obtained at year 5 to assess left ventricular mass left ventricular systolic function with left ventricular ejection fraction mitral velocity over early peak mitral annular velocity ratio
echocardiograms were obtained at 25 to assess left ventricular mass left ventricular diastolic function with left atrial volume mitral velocity over early peak mitral annular velocity ratio
echocardiograms were obtained at 30 visits to assess left ventricular mass left ventricular diastolic function with early peak mitral velocity over early peak mitral annular velocity ratio

left ventricular mass
left atrial volume were indexed to body surface area
at year 30 5 cognitive domains were measured verbal fluency
at year 30 5 cognitive domains were measured processing speed
at year 30 5 cognitive domains were measured global cognition
at year 30 5 cognitive domains were measured executive function delayed verbal memory
25year change cardiac structure and function on midlife cognition using linear regressions
we investigated the association between midlife change
we investigated the association between 25year change
midlife change cardiac structure and function on midlife cognition using linear regressions
the association between 25year change are associated with lower midlife cognition even after accounting for confounders
midlife change cardiac structure and function on midlife cognition change from early to middle adulthood
midlife cardiac structure are associated with lower midlife cognition even after accounting for confounders
midlife cognition using linear regressions
the association between midlife change are associated with lower midlife cognition even after accounting for confounders
25year change cardiac structure and function on midlife cognition change from early to middle adulthood
unlike systolic function midlife left ventricular diastolic function were also linked to cognition
unlike systolic function midlife left midlife 25year change were also linked to cognition
information linking early to function to cognition
information linking early to midlife cardiac structure to cognition
