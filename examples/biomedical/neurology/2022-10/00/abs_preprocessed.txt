longterm treatment with the combination of cilostazol with aspirin showed a lower risk of stroke recurrence compared to aspirin alone after highrisk noncardioembolic ischemic stroke in a randomized trial

the dual medication compared to monotherapy on risk of recurrent ischemic stroke
we aimed to determine whether the effect of the dual medication differs according to timing of starting medication after stroke onset
in a subanalysis of the patients between 8 days after stroke onset were randomly assigned to receive clopidogrel alone
in a subanalysis of the patients between 8 days after stroke onset were randomly assigned to receive aspirin alone
in a subanalysis of the patients between 8 days after stroke onset were randomly a combination of cilostazol with clopidogrel
the randomized controlled trial
in a subanalysis of the patients between 180 days after stroke onset were randomly a combination of cilostazol with clopidogrel
in a subanalysis of the patients between 180 days after stroke onset were randomly assigned to receive aspirin alone
in a subanalysis of the patients between 180 days after stroke onset were randomly a combination of cilostazol with aspirin
in a subanalysis of the patients between 180 days after stroke onset were randomly assigned to receive clopidogrel alone
in a subanalysis of the patients between 8 days after stroke onset were randomly a combination of cilostazol with aspirin
patients between 180 days after stroke onset were divided into 3 groups according to the timing of starting trial treatment
patients between 8 days after stroke onset were divided into 3 groups according to the timing of starting trial treatment
between 8 after stroke onset between 28 days between 29 days after stroke onset
between 8 after stroke onset between 28 days between 180 days after stroke onset
14 days after stroke onset between 15 days after stroke onset
14 days after stroke onset between 15 days between 180 days after stroke onset
between 8 after stroke onset between 15 days between 180 days after stroke onset
between 8 after stroke onset between 15 days between 29 days after stroke onset
between 8 after stroke onset between 15 days after stroke onset
14 days after stroke onset between 15 days between 29 days after stroke onset
14 days after stroke onset between 28 days between 29 days after stroke onset
14 days after stroke onset between 28 days between 180 days after stroke onset
between 8 after stroke onset between 28 days after stroke onset
14 days after stroke onset between 28 days after stroke onset
the primary efficacy outcome was the first recurrence of ischemic stroke
safety outcomes included lifethreatening bleeding
safety outcomes included severe bleeding
of 1879 patients 498 belonged to the 8 to 14 days group to the 15 to 28 days group
of 1879 patients 498 belonged to 467 to 914 to the 29 to 180 days group
of 1879 patients 498 belonged to 467 to the 15 to 28 days group
of 1879 patients 498 belonged to the 8 to 14 days group to 914 to the 29 to 180 days group
there was a significant treatmentbysubgroup interaction for the recurrence of ischemic stroke between trial treatment
there was a significant treatmentbysubgroup interaction for the recurrence of ischemic stroke between trichotomized groups
the recurrence of ischemic stroke was less common with dual therapy than with monotherapy in the 15 to 28 days group in the 8 to 14 days group
the recurrence of ischemic stroke was less common with dual therapy than with monotherapy in the 29 to 180 days group in the 8 to 14 days group
the recurrence of ischemic stroke was similarly common in the 8 to 14 days group
severe bleeding occurred similarly between those on monotherapy in any of the trichotomized groups
lifethreatening bleeding occurred similarly between those on monotherapy in any of the trichotomized groups
lifethreatening bleeding occurred similarly between patients on dual therapy in any of the trichotomized groups
severe bleeding occurred similarly between patients on dual therapy in any of the trichotomized groups
longterm dual antiplatelet therapy using cilostazol starting 15 to 180 days after stroke onset compared to therapy
longterm dual antiplatelet therapy started 8 to 14 days after onset was more effective for secondary stroke prevention than monotherapy without increasing hemorrhage risk
