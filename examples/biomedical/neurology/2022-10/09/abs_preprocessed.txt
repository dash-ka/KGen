the main culprit gene for paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia characterized by brief attacks of involuntary movements is prrt2
the main culprit gene for paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia characterized by recurrent attacks of involuntary movements is prrt2
the location of the primary dysfunction remains a matter of debate
the primary dysfunction associated with paroxysmal dyskinesia
the location of the primary dysfunction may vary depending on the etiology
while striatal dysfunction has often been implicated in these patients evidence from preclinical models indicates that the cerebellum could also play a role
we aimed to investigate the role of the cerebellum in the pathogenesis of prrt2related dyskinesia in humans
we matched controls
we enrolled 22 consecutive righthanded patients with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia with a pathogenic variant of prrt2
participants underwent a multimodal neuroimaging protocol
restingstate fmri during which we tested repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the cerebellum on endogenous brain activity
we recorded restingstate fmri
we recorded anatomic
restingstate fmri during which we tested the aftereffects of sham applied to the cerebellum on endogenous brain activity
we recorded diffusionweighted mri
we quantified the structural integrity of gray matter the structural integrity of white matter and the strength and direction of functional cerebellar connections
the strength and direction of functional cerebellar connections using spectral dynamic causal modeling
gray matter using voxelbased morphometry
the structural integrity of white matter using fixelbased analysis
patients with prrt2 had decreased gray matter volume in the cerebellar lobule vi and in the medial prefrontal cortex microstructural alterations of white matter in the cerebellum and along abnormal communication between the associative cerebellum

cerebellar stimulation modulated communication within associative cerebellar networks
cerebellar stimulation tended to restore this communication to the level
the level observed in healthy controls
cerebellar stimulation modulated communication within the motor
patients with prrt2related dyskinesia have converging structural alterations of related pathways with a dysfunction of cerebellar output toward the cerebellothalamostriatocortical network
patients with prrt2related dyskinesia have converging structural alterations of the motor cerebellum with a dysfunction of cerebellar output toward the cerebellothalamostriatocortical network
we hypothesize that abnormal cerebellar output is the primary dysfunction in patients with a prrt2 pathogenic variant resulting in paroxysmal dyskinesia
we hypothesize that abnormal cerebellar output is the primary dysfunction in patients with a prrt2 pathogenic variant resulting in striatal dysregulation
aberrant cerebellar output transmitted by thalamic relays in certain disorders
more broadly striatal dysfunction in paroxysmal dyskinesia might be secondary to aberrant cerebellar output
