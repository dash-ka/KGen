a complex clinical syndrome that can be defined broalzheimer diseasely as an amnestic multidomain dementia
alzheimer dementia is a complex clinical syndrome
we previously reported human cortical proteins
human cortical proteins that are implicated in alzheimer dementia
human cortical proteins that are implicated in alzheimer dementia
to understand the pathologic correlates of human cortical proteins we investigated cortical protein associations with common agerelated neuropathologies
participants were communitydwelling older alzheimer diseaseults from 2 cohort studies of dementia
participants were communitydwelling older alzheimer diseaseults from 2 cohort studies of aging
brain autopsies were performed after death
all underwent detailed annual clinical evaluations
we use alzheimer dementia to refer to pathologically defined alzheimer dementia to refer to the clinical syndrome
we use alzheimer dementia to refer to pathologically defined disease dementia to refer to the clinical syndrome

logistic regression analysis examined the association of protein expression with each of the neuropathologic indices
a total of 391 older adults were included
associations of eleven human cortical proteins including angiotensinconverting enzyme calciumregulated heatstable protein 1 proprocathepsin hepsin h double c2like domaincontaining protein a islet cell autoantigen 1like protein serine betalactamaselike protein lactb mitochondrial pleckstrin homology domaincontaining family a member 1 replication termination factor 2
eleven human cortical proteins implicated in alzheimer dementia
we did not observe associations of eleven human cortical proteins targets with pathologic diagnosis of alzheimer dementia

in contrast multiple proteins were associated with nonalzheimer disease neurodegenerative
in contrast multiple proteins were associated with cerebrovascular conditions
higher procathepsin h expression was associated with limbic predominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic changes
in particular
higher procathepsin h expression was associated with arteriolosclerosis
higher calciumregulated heatstable protein 1 expression was associated with macroscopic infarcts
higher calciumregulated heatstable protein 1 expression was associated with cortical lewy bodies
the neuropathologic indices investigated
furthermore while higher syntaxin6 expression increased the risk of alzheimer dementia angiotensinconverting enzyme calciumregulated heatstable protein 1 proprocathepsin hepsin h double c2like domaincontaining protein a islet cell autoantigen 1like protein serine betalactamaselike protein lactb mitochondrial pleckstrin homology domaincontaining family a member 1 replication termination factor 2 was not associated with any of the neuropathologic indices

cortical proteins do not necessarily work through alzheimer disease pathogenesis
cortical proteins implicated in alzheimer dementia
rather vascular diseases are at play
rather other pathways are at play
rather nonalzheimer disease neurodegenerative are at play
furthermore some proteins are associated with both neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathologies
furthermore some proteins are pleiotrophic
