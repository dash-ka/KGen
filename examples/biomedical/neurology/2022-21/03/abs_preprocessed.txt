to investigate the potential of plasma neurofilament light as a biomarker of disease progression in progressive multiple sclerosis with and without acute disease activity
to investigate the potential of plasma neurofilament light as a biomarker of treatment response in progressive multiple sclerosis with and without acute disease activity
a post hoc blinded analysis of plasma neurofilament light levels in 2 placebocontrolled was performed
a post hoc blinded analysis of phase 3 studies in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis was performed
a post hoc blinded analysis of primary progressive multiple sclerosis was performed
primary progressive multiple sclerosis using fingolimod respectively as active compounds
primary progressive multiple sclerosis using siponimod respectively as active compounds
plasma neurofilament light levels were quantified using a single molecule array immunoassay from stored ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid plasma samples of all patients
all patients who consented for exploratory biomarker analysis study
all patients who consented for exploratory biomarker analysis in
plasma neurofilament light levels were divided into low at baseline
plasma neurofilament light levels were divided into high at baseline
we investigated the association of plasma neurofilament light levels with disability progression cognitive decline and disability progression cognitive decline and brain atrophy sensitivity to indicate treatment response through clinical measures
we investigated the association of plasma neurofilament light levels with disability progression cognitive decline and brain atrophy cognitive decline and brain atrophy sensitivity to indicate treatment response through clinical measures
baseline plasma neurofilament light levels were higher in sprogressive multiple sclerosis than in progressive multiple sclerosis
in both studies higher baseline plasma neurofilament light levels were associated with older age higher expanded disability status scale score more gdplus lesions and higher t2 lesion load
independent of treatment were associated with significantly higher risks of confirmed higher rates of brain atrophy
independent of low baseline plasma neurofilament light levels were associated with significantly higher risks of confirmed 6month disability progression
independent of high were associated with significantly higher risks of confirmed cognitive decline
independent of low baseline plasma neurofilament light levels were associated with significantly higher risks of confirmed cognitive decline
independent of high were associated with significantly higher risks of confirmed 6month disability progression
independent of low baseline plasma neurofilament light levels were associated with significantly higher risks of confirmed 3month disability progression
independent of high were associated with significantly higher risks of confirmed earlier wheelchair dependence
independent of high were associated with significantly higher risks of confirmed 3month disability progression
independent of low baseline plasma neurofilament light levels were associated with significantly higher risks of confirmed earlier wheelchair dependence
independent of high were associated with significantly higher risks of confirmed higher rates of brain atrophy
independent of treatment were associated with significantly higher risks of confirmed cognitive decline
independent of treatment were associated with significantly higher risks of confirmed 3month disability progression
independent of treatment were associated with significantly higher risks of confirmed earlier wheelchair dependence
independent of low baseline plasma neurofilament light levels were associated with significantly higher risks of confirmed higher rates of brain atrophy
independent of treatment were associated with significantly higher risks of confirmed 6month disability progression
baseline plasma neurofilament light levels were associated with future disability progression regardless of absence of acute disease activity
baseline plasma neurofilament light levels were associated with the degree of brain atrophy regardless of absence of acute disease activity
baseline plasma neurofilament light levels were associated with future disability progression regardless of presence of acute disease activity
baseline plasma neurofilament light levels were associated with the degree of brain atrophy regardless of presence of acute disease activity
patients treated with fingolimod having experienced disability progression
patients treated with higher in those having experienced disability progression
patients treated with placebotreated patients having experienced disability progression
patients treated with siponimod having experienced disability progression
plasma neurofilament light levels were lower in patients
plasma neurofilament light was associated with radiologic disability progression features at the group level
plasma neurofilament light was associated with future clinical at the group level
plasma neurofilament light may be a meaningful outcome measure in progressive multiple sclerosis studies
plasma neurofilament light was reduced by treatment
