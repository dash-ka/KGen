We conducted a multisite, pragmatic replication trial at 4 New England epilepsy centers to determine the effectiveness of Home-Based Self-Management and Cognitive Training Changes Lives in a real-world setting and to assess feasibility of a virtual intervention .

Home-Based Self-Management and Cognitive Training Changes Lives is an 8-session intervention addressing cognitive impairment and quality of life for people with epilepsy . Participants were recruited from epilepsy centers in 4 states and block-randomized into in-person Home-Based Self-Management and Cognitive Training Changes Lives, virtual Home-Based Self-Management and Cognitive Training Changes Lives, and waitlist control . Outcome measures were assessed for all groups at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months . intervention groups received long-term follow-up at 9 and 12 months .

Participants completing the in-person intervention had a 12.4-point improvement in quality of life score compared with controls . There were no meaningful group differences in objective cognition or health care utilization at any time points and the treatment effect for quality of life diminished by 6 months . The virtual intervention demonstrated feasibility but did not significantly improve outcomes compared with controls . 

This study replicated the effectiveness of the Home-Based Self-Management and Cognitive Training Changes Lives program in improving quality of life for people with epilepsy . The study was conducted prior to the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, but the distance-delivered intervention may be particularly well-suited for the current environment .
