we conducted a multisite pragmatic replication trial at 4 new england epilepsy centers to assess feasibility of a virtual intervention
cognitive training changes lives is an 8session intervention
an 8session intervention addressing cognitive impairment and quality of life for people with epilepsy
homebased selfmanagement lives is an 8session intervention
participants were recruited from epilepsy centers in blockrandomized into inperson homebased selfmanagement lives
participants were recruited from waitlist control
participants were recruited from cognitive training changes lives
participants were recruited from epilepsy centers in 4 states lives
participants were recruited from virtual homebased selfmanagement
participants were recruited from epilepsy centers in blockrandomized into cognitive training changes lives
outcome measures were assessed for all groups at baseline
outcome measures were assessed for all groups at 6 months
outcome measures were assessed for all groups at 3 months
intervention groups received longterm followup at 12 months
intervention groups received longterm followup at 9 months
participants completing the inperson intervention
participants had a 124point improvement in quality of life score compared with controls
life diminished by 6 months
there were no meaningful group differences in objective cognition at any time points of life
there were no meaningful group differences in the treatment effect for quality of life
there were no meaningful group differences in health care utilization at any time points of life
the inperson intervention demonstrated feasibility
the inperson intervention did not significantly improve outcomes compared with controls
this study replicated the effectiveness of the homebased selfmanagement in improving quality of life for people with epilepsy
this study replicated the effectiveness of cognitive training changes lives program in improving quality of life for people with epilepsy
this study was conducted prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic
the inperson intervention may be particularly wellsuited for the current environment
