To assess the accuracy of baseline CT perfusion ischemic core estimates .

From SELECT, a prospective multicenter cohort study of imaging selection, patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy who achieved complete reperfusion and had follow-up diffusion-weighted imaging available were evaluated. Follow-up diffusion-weighted imaging lesions were coregistered to baseline CT perfusion . The difference between baseline CT perfusion core volume and follow-up infarct volume was classified as overestimation, adequate, or underestimation and spatial overlap was evaluated .

All patients with overestimation of the subsequent infarct volume were imaged within 90 minutes of LKW and achieved rapid reperfusion . Using rCBF above 20 percent threshold to estimate ischemic core in patients presenting within 90 minutes eliminated overestimation . Volumetric correlation between the ischemic core estimate and follow-up imaging improved as LKW time to imaging acquisition increased . Assessment of the spatial overlap between baseline CT perfusion ischemic core lesion and follow-up infarct demonstrated that a median of 3.2 mL of estimated core fell outside the subsequent infarct . These regions were predominantly in white matter .

Significant overestimation of irreversibly injured ischemic core volume was rare, was only observed in patients who presented within 90 minutes of LKW and achieved reperfusion within 120 minutes of CT perfusion acquisition, and occurred primarily in white matter . Use of a more conservative threshold for estimating ischemic core in patients presenting within 90 minutes eliminated all significant overestimation cases .
