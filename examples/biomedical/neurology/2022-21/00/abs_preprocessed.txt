to assess the accuracy of baseline ct perfusion ischemic core estimates
endovascular thrombectomy who had followup diffusionweighted imaging available
patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy
from select a prospective multicenter cohort study of imaging selection patients were evaluated
endovascular thrombectomy who achieved complete reperfusion
followup diffusionweighted imaging lesions were coregistered to baseline ct perfusion
the difference between baseline ct perfusion core volume was classified as overestimation adequate
underestimation overlap was evaluated
the difference between followup infarct volume was classified as overestimation adequate
spatial overlap was evaluated
all patients with overestimation of the subsequent infarct volume achieved rapid reperfusion
all patients with overestimation of the subsequent infarct volume were imaged within 90 minutes of lkw
patients presenting within 90 minutes
using rcbf above 20 percent threshold to estimate ischemic core in patients eliminated overestimation
the ischemic core estimate improved as lkw time to imaging acquisition
volumetric correlation between the ischemic core estimate increased
followup imaging improved as lkw time to imaging acquisition
volumetric correlation between followup imaging increased
assessment of the spatial overlap between baseline ct perfusion ischemic core lesion demonstrated that a median of 32 ml of estimated core fell outside the subsequent infarct
assessment of the spatial overlap between baseline ct perfusion followup infarct demonstrated that a median of 32 ml of estimated core fell outside the subsequent infarct
a median of 32 ml of estimated core were predominantly in white matter
patients who presented within 90 minutes of lkw and achieved reperfusion within 120 minutes of ct perfusion acquisition and occurred primarily in white matter
significant overestimation of irreversibly injured ischemic core volume was rare was only observed in patients
patients presenting within 90 minutes
use of a more conservative threshold for estimating ischemic core in patients eliminated all significant overestimation cases
