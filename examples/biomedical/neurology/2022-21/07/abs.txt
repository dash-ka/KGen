To describe the prescribing trends for sodium valproate and alternative drugs during and around pregnancy, comparing 2016 with 2013 .

Using the French National Health Insurance Database, a cross-sectional study was carried out in 2013 and in 2016, including women who became pregnant and had at least 1 reimbursement claim for sodium valproate in the 2 years prior to pregnancy or during pregnancy . Exposure to sodium valproate and its alternatives was then measured for each quarter, in the 2 years before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and in the year after pregnancy .

Among pregnant women with epilepsy, the proportion exposed to sodium valproate during pregnancy decreased from 26.4 percent to 9.3 percent between 2013 and 2016, alongside an increase in lamotrigine and levetiracetam use . Among pregnant women with bipolar disorder, the proportion of women exposed during pregnancy decreased from 3.7 percent in 2013 to 1.9 percent in 2016, without any switch to alternative drugs . In both populations, fewer than one third had consulted a specialist before pregnancy .

As recommended by the EMA, a change in practice over the 2013 to 2016 period was observed, with fewer women exposed to sodium valproate during pregnancy and before pregnancy . However, in 2016, a large number of women were exposed to sodium valproate in the first trimester of pregnancy, which could suggest that the timing of pregnancy should be better planned when possible .
