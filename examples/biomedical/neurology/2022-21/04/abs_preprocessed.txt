mild cognitive impairment is an atrisk state for dementia
however not all individuals with mild cognitive impairment transition to dementia revert to normal cognition
however not all individuals with some revert to normal cognition
here we investigate whether the latelife onset of persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms improves the prognostic specificity of mild cognitive impairment
here we investigate whether mild behavioral impairment  improves the prognostic specificity of mild cognitive impairment
participants with mild cognitive impairment from the national alzheimer coordinating center uniform data set were included
neuropsychiatric symptoms were operationalized with the neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire to identify participants without neuropsychiatric symptoms with mild behavioral impairment
neuropsychiatric symptoms were operationalized with the neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire to identify participants without those with mild behavioral impairment
individuals with lateonset neuropsychiatric symptoms not meeting the mild behavioral impairment persistence criterion were retained for secondary analyses
progression to stable mild cognitive impairment to normal cognition after 3 years of followup were defined per national institute on aging alzheimer association
progression to reversion to normal cognition after 3 years of followup were defined per national institute on aging alzheimer association
progression to dementia to normal cognition after 3 years of followup were defined per national institute on petersen criteria
progression to reversion to normal cognition after 3 years of followup were defined per national institute on petersen criteria
progression to dementia to normal cognition after 3 years of followup were defined per national institute on aging alzheimer association
progression to stable mild cognitive impairment to normal cognition after 3 years of followup were defined per national institute on petersen criteria
compared to participants without neuropsychiatric symptoms participants with mild behavioral impairment were significantly more likely to progress to dementia with an annual progression rate of 147 percent
compared to participants without neuropsychiatric symptoms participants with mild behavioral impairment were less likely to revert to normal cognition
lateonset neuropsychiatric symptoms improve the specificity of mild cognitive impairment as an atrisk state for progression to dementia
however only persistent lateonset neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with a lower likelihood of reversion to normal cognition with transient neuropsychiatric symptoms not differing from the neuropsychiatric symptoms group
clinical prognostication can be improved by incorporating lateonset neuropsychiatric symptoms especially those into risk assessments
those that persist
clinical trials may benefit from enrichment with these higherrisk participants with mild cognitive impairment
