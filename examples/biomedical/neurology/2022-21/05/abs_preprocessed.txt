however inconsistent findings have been reported with regard to dementia with lewy bodies
however inconsistent findings have been reported with regard to the disease courses alzheimer disease with lewy bodies
using autopsyconfirmed diagnoses we aimed to examine the disease trajectories in the years before death among patients with dementia with mixed pathologies
using autopsyconfirmed diagnoses we aimed to examine the disease trajectories in the years before death among patients with dementia with pure dementia with lewy bodies
using autopsyconfirmed diagnoses we aimed to examine the disease trajectories in the years before death among patients with dementia with pure alzheimer disease
the current retrospective longitudinal study included 62 participants with mixed alzheimer disease and dementia with lewy bodies from the predictors 2 cohort study a prospective clinicbased cohort of patients with dementia
the current retrospective longitudinal study included 62 participants with pure dementia with lewy bodies from the predictors 2 cohort study a prospective clinicbased cohort of patients with dementia
the current retrospective longitudinal study included 62 participants with autopsyconfirmed diagnoses of pure alzheimer disease from the predictors 2 cohort study a prospective clinicbased cohort of patients with dementia
generalized with time zero at death were used to examine the trajectory of function scale among patients with different autopsyconfirmed diagnosis
generalized with time zero at death were used to examine the trajectory of dependence scale among patients with different autopsyconfirmed diagnosis
generalized estimating equation models
generalized with time zero at death were used to examine the trajectory of cognition scale among patients with different autopsyconfirmed diagnosis

cognition were highly correlated among patients with alzheimer disease and dementia with lewy bodies with lewy bodies at baseline
function were highly correlated among patients with alzheimer disease and dementia with lewy bodies with lewy bodies at baseline
function were highly correlated among patients with alzheimer disease and dementia in pure alzheimer disease with lewy bodies at baseline
cognition were highly correlated among patients with alzheimer disease and dementia in pure alzheimer disease with lewy bodies at baseline
function were highly correlated among patients with alzheimer disease and dementia in pure dementia with lewy bodies at baseline
cognition were highly correlated among patients with alzheimer disease and dementia in pure dementia with lewy bodies at baseline
patients of the 3 groups had different trajectories of decline
patients of the 3 groups all declined in both cognition and function
the mixed pathology group showed double the rate of functional decline as compared to pure alzheimer disease
the patients with pure dementia with lewy bodies experienced approximately double the rate of both cognitive decline than the patients with pure alzheimer disease
more specifically
the patients with pure dementia with lewy bodies experienced approximately double the rate of functional decline than the patients with pure alzheimer disease
in the current retrospective longitudinal study we found that among patients with dementia those with lewy body pathology experienced faster cognitive and functional decline than those with pure alzheimer disease pathology
