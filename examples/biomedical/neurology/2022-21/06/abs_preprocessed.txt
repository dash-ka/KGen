cox proportional hazards regression models were conducted
a relationship remaining strong in sesadjusted models
an inverse relationship was detected between serum betacryptoxanthin for ageadjusted models
an inverse relationship was detected between allbecause dementia for ageadjusted models
an inverse relationship was detected between serum betacryptoxanthin for a relationship
an inverse relationship attenuated in subsequent models
an inverse relationship was detected between allbecause dementia for a relationship
an inverse relationship was detected between allbecause dementia for sexadjusted models

antagonistic interactions indicate putative protective effects of 1 carotenoid may be observed at lower levels other carotenoids
antagonistic interactions indicate putative protective effects of 1 carotenoid may be observed at antioxidant vitamin
incident allbecause dementia was inversely associated with betacryptoxanthin levels
incident allbecause dementia was inversely associated with serum luteinzeaxanthin
further studies with randomized trials are needed to test neuroprotective effects of supplementing the diet with select carotenoids
further studies with timedependent exposures trials are needed to test neuroprotective effects of supplementing the diet with select carotenoids
