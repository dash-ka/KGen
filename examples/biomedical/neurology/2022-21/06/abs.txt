Serum antioxidant vitamins and carotenoids may protect against neurodegeneration with age . We examined associations of these nutritional biomarkers with incident all-cause and Alzheimer disease dementia among US middle-aged and older adults .

Using data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, linked with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid follow-up data, we tested associations and interactions of serum vitamins A, C, and E and total and individual serum carotenoids and interactions with incident Alzheimer disease and all-cause dementia . Cox proportional hazards regression models were conducted .

An inverse relationship was detected between serum Beta-cryptoxanthin and all-cause dementia for age-adjusted and sex-adjusted models, a relationship remaining strong in SES-adjusted models, but attenuated in subsequent models . Antagonistic interactions indicate putative protective effects of 1 carotenoid may be observed at lower levels other carotenoids or antioxidant vitamin .

Incident all-cause dementia was inversely associated with serum lutein+zeaxanthin and Beta-cryptoxanthin levels . Further studies with time-dependent exposures and randomized trials are needed to test neuroprotective effects of supplementing the diet with select carotenoids .
