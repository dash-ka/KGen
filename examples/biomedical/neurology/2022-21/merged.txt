to assess the accuracy of baseline ct perfusion ischemic core estimates
endovascular thrombectomy who had followup diffusionweighted imaging available
patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy
from select a prospective multicenter cohort study of imaging selection patients were evaluated
endovascular thrombectomy who achieved complete reperfusion
followup diffusionweighted imaging lesions were coregistered to baseline ct perfusion
the difference between baseline ct perfusion core volume was classified as overestimation adequate
underestimation overlap was evaluated
the difference between followup infarct volume was classified as overestimation adequate
spatial overlap was evaluated
all patients with overestimation of the subsequent infarct volume achieved rapid reperfusion
all patients with overestimation of the subsequent infarct volume were imaged within 90 minutes of lkw
patients presenting within 90 minutes
using rcbf above 20 percent threshold to estimate ischemic core in patients eliminated overestimation
the ischemic core estimate improved as lkw time to imaging acquisition
volumetric correlation between the ischemic core estimate increased
followup imaging improved as lkw time to imaging acquisition
volumetric correlation between followup imaging increased
assessment of the spatial overlap between baseline ct perfusion ischemic core lesion demonstrated that a median of 32 ml of estimated core fell outside the subsequent infarct
assessment of the spatial overlap between baseline ct perfusion followup infarct demonstrated that a median of 32 ml of estimated core fell outside the subsequent infarct
a median of 32 ml of estimated core were predominantly in white matter
patients who presented within 90 minutes of lkw and achieved reperfusion within 120 minutes of ct perfusion acquisition and occurred primarily in white matter
significant overestimation of irreversibly injured ischemic core volume was rare was only observed in patients
patients presenting within 90 minutes
use of a more conservative threshold for estimating ischemic core in patients eliminated all significant overestimation casesboth environmental factors contribute to stroke risk

an acquired disease that involves lung
the idiopathic inflammatory myopathy dermatomyositis is an acquired disease
an acquired disease that involves skin impairments
patients with dermatomyositis show a wide range of severity of proximal skeletal muscle weakness
proximal skeletal muscle weakness associated with inflammatory infiltrates
proximal skeletal muscle weakness associated with perifascicular myofiber atrophy
proximal skeletal muscle weakness associated with capillary dropout
proximal skeletal muscle weakness associated with vasculitis
muscles of patients with dermatomyositis show signs of muscle regeneration
because muscle stem cells are responsible for myofiber repair we wondered whether the proliferative properties of muscle stem cells are altered in dermatomyositis muscle
we investigated the role of type i interferon in this process because dermatomyositis is associated with sustained inflammation with high type i interferon levels
muscle stem cells isolated from those from adult patients with dermatomyositis
muscle stem cells isolated from those from juvenile patients with dermatomyositis
muscle stem cells were analyzed in vitro for senescence

gainoffunction were performed to assess the role of type i interferon signaling in the proliferative capacities of muscle stem cells
lossoffunction experiments were performed to assess the role of type i interferon signaling in the proliferative capacities of muscle stem cells
dmmuscle stem cells exhibited strongly reduced proliferating capacities as compared with healthy muscle stem cells
reduced proliferating capacities as compared with healthy muscle stem cells leading to poor myotube formation
dmmuscle stem cells were enriched in senescent betagalactosidasepositive cells partly explaining the proliferation defect
high concentrations of type i interferon decreased the proliferation of healthy muscle stem cells
the proliferation of healthy muscle stem cells suggesting the delivery of an autocrine effector
similarly conditioned medium from dmmuscle stem cells decreased the proliferation of healthy muscle stem cells
pharmacologic blockade of ifn signaling in dmmuscle stem cells rescued dmmuscle stem cells proliferation up to the control values
musc expansion leading to muscle repair deficit
these results show that autocrine type i interferon signaling prevents musc expansion
this process may explain the persistent muscle weakness

compared to participants without neuropsychiatric symptoms participants with mild behavioral impairment were significantly more likely to progress to dementia with an annual progression rate of 147 percent
compared to participants without neuropsychiatric symptoms participants with mild behavioral impairment were less likely to revert to normal cognition
lateonset neuropsychiatric symptoms improve the specificity of mild cognitive impairment as an atrisk state for progression to dementia
however only persistent lateonset neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with a lower likelihood of reversion to normal cognition with transient neuropsychiatric symptoms not differing from the neuropsychiatric symptoms group
clinical prognostication can be improved by incorporating lateonset neuropsychiatric symptoms especially those into risk assessments
