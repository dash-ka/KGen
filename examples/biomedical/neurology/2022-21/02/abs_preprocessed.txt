an acquired disease that involves muscle
an acquired disease that involves lung
the idiopathic inflammatory myopathy dermatomyositis is an acquired disease
an acquired disease that involves skin impairments
patients with dermatomyositis show a wide range of severity of proximal skeletal muscle weakness
proximal skeletal muscle weakness associated with inflammatory infiltrates
proximal skeletal muscle weakness associated with perifascicular myofiber atrophy
proximal skeletal muscle weakness associated with capillary dropout
proximal skeletal muscle weakness associated with vasculitis
muscles of patients with dermatomyositis show signs of muscle regeneration
because muscle stem cells are responsible for myofiber repair we wondered whether the proliferative properties of muscle stem cells are altered in dermatomyositis muscle
we investigated the role of type i interferon in this process because dermatomyositis is associated with sustained inflammation with high type i interferon levels
muscle stem cells isolated from those from adult patients with dermatomyositis
muscle stem cells isolated from those from juvenile patients with dermatomyositis
muscle stem cells were analyzed in vitro for senescence
muscle stem cells were analyzed in vitro for myogenic capacities
muscle stem cells were grown in culture
muscle stem cells were analyzed in vitro for those proliferating properties
muscle stem cells isolated from normal muscles from juvenile patients with dermatomyositis
muscle stem cells isolated from normal muscles from adult patients with dermatomyositis
gainoffunction were performed to assess the role of type i interferon signaling in the proliferative capacities of muscle stem cells
lossoffunction experiments were performed to assess the role of type i interferon signaling in the proliferative capacities of muscle stem cells
dmmuscle stem cells exhibited strongly reduced proliferating capacities as compared with healthy muscle stem cells
reduced proliferating capacities as compared with healthy muscle stem cells leading to poor myotube formation
dmmuscle stem cells were enriched in senescent betagalactosidasepositive cells partly explaining the proliferation defect
high concentrations of type i interferon decreased the proliferation of healthy muscle stem cells
the proliferation of healthy muscle stem cells suggesting the delivery of an autocrine effector
similarly conditioned medium from dmmuscle stem cells decreased the proliferation of healthy muscle stem cells
pharmacologic blockade of ifn signaling in dmmuscle stem cells rescued dmmuscle stem cells proliferation up to the control values
musc expansion leading to muscle repair deficit
these results show that autocrine type i interferon signaling prevents musc expansion
this process may explain the persistent muscle weakness
the persistent muscle weakness observed in patients with severe dermatomyositis
