both environmental factors contribute to stroke risk
both genetic factors contribute to stroke risk
novel metabolites associated with incident stroke in the reasons for geographic differences in stroke cohort
novel metabolites associated with incident stroke in the reasons for racial differences in stroke cohort
we sought to determine whether stroke cohort reflected environmental variation
we sought to identify novel metabolites
we sought to determine whether stroke cohort reflected genetic variation
this was a stroke casecohort observational study nested in reasons for geographic differences in stroke
this was a stroke casecohort observational study nested in reasons for racial differences in stroke
cases were defined as incident stroke
metabolomic profiles were compared to a randomly selected control cohort
in baseline plasma samples 162 metabolites were measured using liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry
cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for age by race in the base model
cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for age by race in the base model
cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for sex by race in the base model
cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for race by race in the base model
fully adjusted models included traditional stroke risk factors
mediation analyses conducted for these stroke risk factors
mediation analyses used these stroke risk factors as mediator
genomewide associations with the leading candidate metabolites were calculated using array data
replication analyses in the jackson heart study were conducted using random effects metaanalysis
nine metabolites were associated with stroke in the base model
the base model 8 of which were measured
the base model 8 of which remained significant in metaanalysis with the jackson heart study
in the fully adjusted model in reasons for geographic differences in stroke guanosine were associated with incident ischemic stroke following bonferroni adjustment
in the fully adjusted model in reasons for racial differences in stroke guanosine were associated with incident ischemic stroke following bonferroni adjustment
in the fully adjusted model in reasons for geographic differences in stroke pseudouridine were associated with incident ischemic stroke following bonferroni adjustment
in the fully adjusted model in reasons for racial differences in stroke pseudouridine were associated with incident ischemic stroke following bonferroni adjustment
guanosine also partially mediated the relationship between hypertension did not mediate any risk factor
guanosine also partially mediated the relationship between stroke did not mediate any risk factor
guanosine also partially mediated the relationship between pseudouridine did not mediate any risk factor
loci rs34631560 and rs34631560 associated with pseudouridine
genomewide association analysis identified loci rs34631560 and rs34631560
these did not explain the association of pseudouridine with stroke
guanosine are nucleosides
nucleosides associated with incident ischemic stroke independently of other risk factors
pseudouridine are nucleosides
genetic analyses suggest that environmental exposures to stroke risk
genetic analyses suggest that genetic variation link nucleoside levels to stroke risk
mediation analyses suggest that environmental exposures to stroke risk
mediation analyses suggest that genetic variation link nucleoside levels to stroke risk
