risk of bias was assessed using a standardized appraisal tool for studies
studies reporting prevalence
certainty of evidence was evaluated using the grading of recommendations
certainty of evidence was evaluated using the grading of evaluations approach
certainty of evidence was evaluated using the grading of development
certainty of evidence was evaluated using the grading of assessment
17 studies were included for analysis
a total of 750 records were screened
outlier exclusion using screening method as a moderator
after outlier exclusion the pooled prevalence of bipolar symptoms in people with epilepsy was 123 percent
subgroup analysis using screening method as a moderator
after subgroup analysis the pooled prevalence of bipolar symptoms in people with epilepsy was 123 percent
the pooled prevalence of bipolar disorder in people with epilepsy was 45 percent
considerable heterogeneity was present more so for bipolar disorder than for bipolar symptoms and could be explained through differences in population demographics
considerable heterogeneity was present more so for bipolar disorder than for bipolar symptoms and could be explained through differences in study methodology
the main limitation of this study was regarding the certainty of evidence
however our estimates of prevalence should prompt further research on bipolar disorder in people with epilepsy

the significant morbidity associated with bipolar disorder
given the significant morbidity clinicians should carefully screen people with epilepsy for bipolar symptoms
