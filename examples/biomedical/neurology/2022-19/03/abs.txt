This systematic review with meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled lifetime prevalence of bipolar symptoms and bipolar disorder in people with epilepsy .

A search was performed on June 5, 2021, in 4 databases for original research reporting on bipolar symptoms and bipolar disorder in people with epilepsy, with no restriction on language or time of publication . To calculate pooled lifetime prevalence of bipolar symptoms and bipolar disorder, 2 meta-analytic random-effects models were fitted, one for bipolar symptoms and the other for bipolar disorder . Risk of bias was assessed using a standardized appraisal tool for studies reporting prevalence . Certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach .

A total of 750 records were screened and 17 studies were included for analysis . After outlier exclusion and subgroup analysis using screening method as a moderator, the pooled prevalence of bipolar symptoms in people with epilepsy was 12.3 percent . The pooled prevalence of bipolar disorder in people with epilepsy was 4.5 percent . Considerable heterogeneity was present, more so for bipolar disorder than for bipolar symptoms, and could be explained through differences in population demographics and study methodology .

The main limitation of this study was regarding the certainty of evidence . However, our estimates of prevalence should prompt further research on bipolar symptoms and bipolar disorder in people with epilepsy . Given the significant morbidity associated with bipolar disorder, clinicians should carefully screen people with epilepsy for bipolar symptoms .
