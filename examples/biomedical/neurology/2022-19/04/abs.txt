Epilepsy is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and premature mortality, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy . Serious cardiac arrythmias might go undetected in routine epilepsy and cardiac investigations .

This prospective cohort study aimed to detect cardiac arrhythmias in patients with chronic drug-resistant epilepsy using subcutaneous cardiac monitors for a minimum follow-up duration of 12 months . Participants with known cardiovascular disease or those with abnormal 12-lead ECGs were excluded .

Thirty-one patients underwent subcutaneous cardiac monitoring for a median recording duration of 2.2 years . The time to first detection of a clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia ranged between 1.2 and 26.9 months following cardiac monitor insertion .

Implantable cardiac monitors detected a high incidence of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias in patients with chronic drug-resistant epilepsy, which may contribute to the incidence of premature mortality, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy .
