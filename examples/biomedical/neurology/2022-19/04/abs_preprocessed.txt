epilepsy is associated with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy
epilepsy is associated with an increased risk in epilepsy
serious cardiac arrythmias might go undetected in routine epilepsy
serious cardiac arrythmias might go undetected in cardiac investigations
this prospective cohort study aimed to detect cardiac arrhythmias in patients with chronic drugresistant epilepsy
patients with chronic drugresistant epilepsy using subcutaneous cardiac monitors for a minimum followup duration of 12 months
those with abnormal 12lead ecgs were excluded
participants with known cardiovascular disease were excluded
thirtyone patients underwent subcutaneous cardiac monitoring for a median recording duration of 22 years
the time to first detection of a clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia ranged between 12 months following cardiac monitor insertion
the time to first detection of a clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia ranged 269 months following cardiac monitor insertion
implantable cardiac monitors detected a high incidence of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias in patients with chronic drugresistant epilepsy
