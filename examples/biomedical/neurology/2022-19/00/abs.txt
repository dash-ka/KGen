The goal of this work was to evaluate whether patients with epilepsy were more susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 infection and at greater risk of severe complications when infected with Coronavirus disease 2019 compared with patients without epilepsy .

We included participants who underwent at least 1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 real-time reverse-transcription PCR test between January 1 and June 4, 2020, from the Korean nationwide Coronavirus disease 2019 dataset . Epilepsy was defined according to the presence of diagnostic code in health claims data before the Coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis . To investigate the association between epilepsy and the susceptibility for or severe complications of Coronavirus disease 2019, a 1 to 6 ratio propensity score matching and logistic regression analysis were performed . Severe complications with Coronavirus disease 2019 infection were defined as a composite of the incidence of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and death within 2 months after Coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis .

Among 212,678 study participants who underwent a Coronavirus disease 2019 test, 3,919 had a history of epilepsy . After propensity score matching, there was no significant difference in Coronavirus disease 2019 PCR positivity according to epilepsy history . Of the 7,713 individuals with confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 infection, 72 had a history of epilepsy . Among the patients with Coronavirus disease 2019, severe complications occurred in 444 individuals . After propensity score matching, the presence of epilepsy was associated with the occurrence of severe complications after Coronavirus disease 2019 infection . Mortality after Coronavirus disease 2019 infection did not differ according to the presence of epilepsy history .

The presence of epilepsy was not associated with increased susceptibility to Coronavirus disease 2019 infection or mortality related to the infection . However, there was an increased risk of severe complications with Coronavirus disease 2019 in patients with epilepsy; therefore, careful management and monitoring may be necessary .
