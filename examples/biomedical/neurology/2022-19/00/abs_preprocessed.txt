the goal of this work was to evaluate whether patients with epilepsy were more susceptible at greater risk of severe complications
the goal of this work was to evaluate whether patients with epilepsy were more susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 infection
severe complications when infected with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with epilepsy
participants who underwent at least 1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 realtime reversetranscription pcr test between january 1
we included participants
participants who underwent june 4 2020 from the korean nationwide coronavirus disease 2019 dataset
epilepsy was defined according to the presence of diagnostic code in health claims data before the coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis
to investigate the association between epilepsy logistic regression analysis were performed
to investigate the susceptibility for a 1 to 6 ratio propensity score matching were performed
to investigate severe complications of coronavirus disease 2019 a 1 to 6 ratio propensity score matching were performed
to investigate the association between epilepsy a 1 to 6 ratio propensity score matching were performed
to investigate the susceptibility for logistic regression analysis were performed
to investigate severe complications of coronavirus disease 2019 logistic regression analysis were performed
severe complications with coronavirus disease 2019 infection were defined as a composite of the incidence of intensive care unit admission within 2 months after coronavirus disease 2019 infection 2019 diagnosis
severe complications with coronavirus disease 2019 infection were defined as a composite of the incidence of death within 2 months after coronavirus disease 2019 infection 2019 diagnosis
severe complications with coronavirus disease 2019 infection were defined as a composite of the incidence of mechanical ventilation within 2 months after coronavirus disease 2019 infection 2019 diagnosis
212678 study participants who underwent a coronavirus disease 2019 test
among 212678 study participants 3919 had a history of epilepsy
after propensity score matching there was no significant difference in coronavirus disease 2019 pcr positivity according to epilepsy history
of the 7713 individuals with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 infection 2019 infection 72 had a history of epilepsy
among the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 severe complications occurred in 444 individuals
after propensity score matching the presence of epilepsy was associated with the occurrence of severe complications after coronavirus disease 2019 infection
mortality after coronavirus disease 2019 infection did not differ according to the presence of epilepsy history
the presence of epilepsy was not associated with increased susceptibility to mortality related to 2019 infection
the presence of epilepsy was not associated with increased susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 infection
however there was an increased risk of severe complications with coronavirus disease 2019 in patients with epilepsy therefore careful management may be necessary
however there was an increased risk of severe complications with coronavirus disease 2019 in patients with epilepsy therefore monitoring may be necessary
