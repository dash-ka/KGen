information on stroke among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines remains scarce
we report stroke incidence as this retrospective descriptive study
this retrospective descriptive study analyzed stroke incidence per million doses among hospitalized adult patients during an 8month interval
according to the world health organization adverse event following immunizations were defined as clinical events and categorized as either nonserious or serious depending on treatment
according to the world health organization adverse event following immunizations were defined as clinical events and categorized as either nonserious or serious depending on hospital admission requirements
according to the world health organization adverse event following immunizations were defined as clinical events and categorized as either nonserious or serious depending on severity
clinical events occurring within 30 days after immunization
intracerebral hemorrhage were collected through a passive epidemiologic surveillance system
acute ischemic stroke were collected through a passive epidemiologic surveillance system
subarachnoid hemorrhage were collected through a passive epidemiologic surveillance system
cerebral venous thrombosis cases were collected through a passive epidemiologic surveillance system
a passive epidemiologic surveillance system in which local health providers report potential adverse event following immunization to the mexican general board of epidemiology
committee appointed by the mexican ministry of health to evaluate potential neurologic adverse event following immunization against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
data were captured with standardized case report formats by an ad hoc committee 2
the mexican ministry of health included 56 patients for an overall incidence of 071 cases per 1000000 administered doses
in 27 patients this retrospective descriptive study was diagnosed within the first 24 hours after immunization
43 patients followed by cerebral venous thrombosis
43 patients followed by subarachnoid hemorrhage
43 patients followed by intracerebral hemorrhage in 9
the most frequent subtype was acute ischemic stroke in 43 patients each with 2 cases
overall the most common risk factors were hypertension in 33 patients and diabetes in 22
median hospital length of stay was 6 days
at discharge functional outcome was good in 411 percent of patients
inhospital mortality rate was 214 percent
stroke is an exceedingly rare adverse event following immunization against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
preexisting stroke risk factors were identified in most patients
further research is needed to evaluate causal associations between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines
