ischemic stroke increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders
however the risk of autism is not thoroughly explored
our aim was to evaluate risk of autism factors for autism in children with pediatric ischemic stroke and in children with pediatric ischemic stroke firstdegree relatives
our aim was to evaluate risk of risk factors for autism in children with pediatric ischemic stroke and in children with pediatric ischemic stroke firstdegree relatives
in this cohort study individuals without prior autism were identified in swedish national registers
in this cohort study individuals over 18 years of age alive 1 week after stroke were identified in swedish national registers
in this cohort study individuals with ischemic stroke from 1969 to 2016 were identified in swedish national registers
ten matched controls per index individual were identified
ten matched controls per all firstdegree relatives of index individuals and controls were identified
conditional cox regression was used to calculate the risk of autism
unconditional logistic regression was performed to analyze sex gestational age as risk factors for autism in children with ischemic stroke
unconditional logistic regression was performed to analyze a sibling with autism as risk factors for autism in children with ischemic stroke
unconditional logistic regression was performed to analyze comorbid adverse motor outcome as risk factors for autism in children with ischemic stroke
unconditional logistic regression was performed to analyze age at stroke diagnoses as risk factors for autism in children with ischemic stroke
unconditional logistic regression was performed to analyze comorbid epilepsy as risk factors for autism in children with ischemic stroke
of the 1322 index individuals 46 were diagnosed with autism compared to 161 controls
there was no significant difference in risk of autism according to age at stroke
the increased risk remained when children with stroke diagnosed from 1997 to 2014 were analyzed
the increased risk remained after exclusion of children small for gestational age were analyzed
the increased risk remained after exclusion of children born preterm were analyzed
compared to controls the increased risk remained after exclusion of children small for gestational age was increased in individuals with comorbid epilepsy
compared to controls the increased risk remained after exclusion of children born preterm was increased in individuals with ischemic stroke
compared to controls the increased risk remained when children with stroke diagnosed from 1997 to 2014 was increased in adverse motor outcome
compared to controls the increased risk remained after exclusion of children born preterm was increased in adverse motor outcome
compared to controls the increased risk remained after exclusion of children born preterm was increased in individuals with comorbid epilepsy
compared to controls the increased risk remained after exclusion of children small for gestational age was increased in individuals with ischemic stroke
compared to controls the increased risk remained when children with stroke diagnosed from 1997 to 2014 was increased in individuals with comorbid epilepsy
compared to controls the increased risk remained after exclusion of children small for gestational age was increased in adverse motor outcome
compared to controls the increased risk remained when children with stroke diagnosed from 1997 to 2014 was increased in individuals with ischemic stroke
when individuals with adverse motor outcome and epilepsy were censored the increased risk remained after when children with stroke diagnosed from 1997 to 2014 was still increased
when individuals with adverse motor outcome and epilepsy were censored the increased risk remained after exclusion of children born preterm
when individuals with adverse motor outcome and epilepsy were censored the increased risk remained after exclusion of children small for gestational age
sex gestational age were not associated with autism in individuals with pediatric ischemic stroke
having a sibling with autism were not associated with autism in individuals with pediatric ischemic stroke
an increased risk of autism could not be explained by being born preterm
an increased risk of autism was seen after pediatric ischemic stroke particularly in individuals with comorbid epilepsy
an increased risk of autism could not be explained by small for gestational age
an increased risk of autism was increased also in individuals free from epilepsy motor outcome implying that all children with ischemic stroke should be readily screened for autism if the disorder is suspected
