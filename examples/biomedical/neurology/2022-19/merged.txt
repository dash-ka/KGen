212678 study participants who underwent a coronavirus disease 2019 test
among 212678 study participants 3919 had a history of epilepsy
after propensity score matching there was no significant difference in coronavirus disease 2019 pcr positivity according to epilepsy history
of the 7713 individuals with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 infection 2019 infection 72 had a history of epilepsy
among the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 severe complications occurred in 444 individuals

we tested the hypothesis that older adults have a lower risk of developing parkinsonism
older adults using statins
we studied older adults with annual clinical testing of 4 parkinsonian signs based on inspection of all medications
we studied older adults with assessment of statin use based on inspection of all medications
parkinsonism was present if there was clinical evidence of above 2 parkinsonian signs
postmortem brain examination collected indices of pathologies including atherosclerosis of the large vessels of the circle of willis
we examined whether baseline statin use was related to incident parkinsonism
then in decedents we examined whether pathologies linked the association of statin use to parkinsonism
then in decedents we examined whether statin use before death was related to pathologies
parkinsonism that may be partially mediated by a lower odds of brain atherosclerosis
