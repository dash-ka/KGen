narcolepsy usually begin in early adolescence
idiopathic hypersomnia usually begin in early adolescence
diagnostic delays are common affecting disease burden
diagnostic delays ranging from 5 to 10 years
to improve early identification of these treatable conditions we developed the pediatric hypersomnolence survey
to improve early identification of these treatable conditions we validated the pediatric hypersomnolence survey
content was developed through literature review
content was developed through field testing
content was developed through patient focus groups
content was developed through interviews with experts in the field
we then validated the 14item selfreported survey across 3 hospitals from patient groups
we then validated the 14item selfreported survey across web recruitment from patient groups
in the validation phase we recruited a total of 331 participants to complete the pediatric hypersomnolence survey
hypersomnolence using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis
we assessed a range of psychometric properties including discriminant diagnostic validity for cns disorders of hypersomnolence
hypersomnolence using reliability across a 1week period
good reliability expressed by satisfactory omega values
confirmatory factor analysis indicated a 4domain solution with good reliability
other validated surveys of sleepiness correlations with multiple sleep latency test measures
across groups the pediatric hypersomnolence survey total score showed appropriate positive correlations with other
other validated surveys of negative correlations with multiple sleep latency test measures
compared to controls with other sleep disorders the area under the curve for participants with idiopathic hypersomnia was 087 with high sensitivity and specificity
compared to patients with other sleep disorders the area under the curve for participants with idiopathic hypersomnia was 087 with high sensitivity and specificity
compared to controls with other sleep disorders the area under the curve for participants with narcolepsy hypersomnia was 087 with high sensitivity and specificity
compared to patients with other sleep disorders the area under the curve for participants with narcolepsy hypersomnia was 087 with high sensitivity and specificity
the pediatric hypersomnolence survey is a reliable tool for clinicians to identify pediatric patients with idiopathic hypersomnia
the pediatric hypersomnolence survey is a valid tool for clinicians to identify pediatric patients with idiopathic hypersomnia
the pediatric hypersomnolence survey is a reliable tool for clinicians to identify pediatric patients with narcolepsy
the pediatric hypersomnolence survey is a valid tool for clinicians to identify pediatric patients with narcolepsy
implemented in clinical practice the pediatric hypersomnolence survey will potentially decrease diagnostic delays and time to treatment ultimately reducing disease burden for these debilitating conditions
