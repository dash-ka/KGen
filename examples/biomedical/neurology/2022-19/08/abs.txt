Narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia usually begin in early adolescence, but diagnostic delays ranging from 5 to 10 years are common, affecting disease burden . To improve early identification of these treatable conditions, we developed and validated the Pediatric Hypersomnolence Survey .

Content was developed through literature review, patient focus groups, interviews with experts in the field, and field testing . We then validated the 14-item self-reported survey across 3 hospitals and web recruitment from patient groups . In the validation phase, we recruited a total of 331 participants to complete the survey . We assessed a range of psychometric properties, including discriminant diagnostic validity for CNS disorders of hypersomnolence using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and reliability across a 1-week period .

Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a 4-domain solution with good reliability expressed by satisfactory omega values . Across groups, the Pediatric Hypersomnolence Survey total score showed appropriate positive correlations with other validated surveys of sleepiness and negative correlations with multiple sleep latency test measures . Compared to controls and patients with other sleep disorders, the area under the curve for participants with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia was 0.87 with high sensitivity and specificity .

The Pediatric Hypersomnolence Survey is a valid and reliable tool for clinicians to identify pediatric patients with narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia . Implemented in clinical practice, the Pediatric Hypersomnolence Survey will potentially decrease diagnostic delays and time to treatment, ultimately reducing disease burden for these debilitating conditions .
