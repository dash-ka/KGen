The burden of cerebrovascular disease pathologies is associated with progressive parkinsonism in older adults . We tested the hypothesis that older adults using statins have a lower risk of developing parkinsonism .

We studied older adults with annual clinical testing of 4 parkinsonian signs and assessment of statin use based on inspection of all medications . Parkinsonism was present if there was clinical evidence of above 2 parkinsonian signs . Postmortem brain examination collected indices of pathologies, including atherosclerosis of the large vessels of the circle of Willis . We examined whether baseline statin use was related to incident parkinsonism . Then in decedents, we examined whether statin use before death was related to pathologies and whether pathologies linked the association of statin use to parkinsonism .


Adults using statins have a lower risk of parkinsonism that may be partially mediated by a lower odds of brain atherosclerosis . These findings highlight the role of cerebrovascular pathologies in late-life parkinsonism and suggest a potential role for statins in decreasing its magnitude .
