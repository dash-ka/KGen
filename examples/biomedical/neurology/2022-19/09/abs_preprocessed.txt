the burden of cerebrovascular disease pathologies is associated with progressive parkinsonism in older adults
we tested the hypothesis that older adults have a lower risk of developing parkinsonism
older adults using statins
we studied older adults with annual clinical testing of 4 parkinsonian signs based on inspection of all medications
we studied older adults with assessment of statin use based on inspection of all medications
parkinsonism was present if there was clinical evidence of above 2 parkinsonian signs
postmortem brain examination collected indices of pathologies including atherosclerosis of the large vessels of the circle of willis
we examined whether baseline statin use was related to incident parkinsonism
then in decedents we examined whether pathologies linked the association of statin use to parkinsonism
then in decedents we examined whether statin use before death was related to pathologies
parkinsonism that may be partially mediated by a lower odds of brain atherosclerosis
these findings have a lower risk of parkinsonism
these findings highlight the role of cerebrovascular pathologies in latelife parkinsonism
these findings suggest a potential role for statins in decreasing cerebrovascular pathologies in latelife parkinsonism magnitude
