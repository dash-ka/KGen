prolonged poststroke cardiac rhythm monitoring reveals a substantial proportion of patients with ischemic stroke with atrial fibrillation not detected by conventional rhythm monitoring strategies
we evaluated the institution of stroke recurrence
we evaluated the association between poststroke cardiac rhythm monitoring
we evaluated the institution of stroke preventive strategies
studies reporting stroke recurrence rates in patients with history of tia receiving poststroke cardiac rhythm monitoring compared with patients

poststroke cardiac rhythm monitoring was associated with a lower risk of recurrent stroke in randomized controlled trials
poststroke cardiac rhythm monitoring was associated with a lower risk of recurrent stroke during followup in observational studies
in indirect analyses of randomized controlled trials the likelihood of atrial fibrillation detection was higher for implantable loop recorders compared with holter monitors
in indirect analyses of randomized controlled trials the likelihood of anticoagulation initiation was higher for implantable loop recorders compared with holter monitors
in indirect analyses of randomized controlled trials the likelihood of atrial fibrillation detection was higher for implantable loop recorders compared with external loop recorders
in indirect analyses of randomized controlled trials the likelihood of anticoagulation initiation was higher for implantable loop recorders compared with external loop recorders
poststroke cardiac rhythm monitoring after an ischemic stroke or tia can lead to higher rates of atrial fibrillation detection
poststroke cardiac rhythm monitoring after an ischemic stroke or tia can lead to higher rates of anticoagulant initiation
no solid randomized controlled trial evidence supporting that poststroke cardiac rhythm monitoring may be associated with lower stroke recurrence risk
there is no solid
