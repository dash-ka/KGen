Prolonged poststroke cardiac rhythm monitoring reveals a substantial proportion of patients with ischemic stroke with atrial fibrillation not detected by conventional rhythm monitoring strategies . We evaluated the association between poststroke cardiac rhythm monitoring and the institution of stroke preventive strategies and stroke recurrence .

We searched MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases to identify studies reporting stroke recurrence rates in patients with history of recent ischemic stroke or TIA receiving poststroke cardiac rhythm monitoring compared with patients receiving conventional cardiac rhythm monitoring . Pairwise meta-analyses were performed under the random effects model . To explore for differences between the monitoring strategies, we combined direct and indirect evidence for any given pair of monitoring devices assessed within a randomized controlled trial .

We included 8 studies . Patients receiving poststroke cardiac rhythm monitoring after their index event had a higher rate of atrial fibrillation detection and anticoagulant initiation in randomized controlled trials and observational studies . poststroke cardiac rhythm monitoring was associated with a lower risk of recurrent stroke during follow-up in observational studies, but not in randomized controlled trials . In indirect analyses of randomized controlled trials, the likelihood of atrial fibrillation detection and anticoagulation initiation was higher for implantable loop recorders compared with Holter monitors and external loop recorders .

poststroke cardiac rhythm monitoring after an ischemic stroke or TIA can lead to higher rates of atrial fibrillation detection and anticoagulant initiation . There is no solid randomized controlled trial evidence supporting that poststroke cardiac rhythm monitoring may be associated with lower stroke recurrence risk .
