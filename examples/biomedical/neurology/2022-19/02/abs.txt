Seizure outcome after extratemporal lobe epilepsy surgery has often been poorer than after temporal lobe epilepsy surgery, but recent improvements in diagnostics and surgery may have changed this . Our aim was to analyze the changes in presurgical and surgical volumes and seizure outcome 2 years after surgery for patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy compared with those with temporal lobe epilepsy .

We performed a retrospective, single-center cohort study including patients from the Bethel presurgical-surgical-postsurgical database from 1990 to 2017 . We used logistic regression to analyze factors influencing the odds for surgery and the odds for seizure freedom after surgery .

We included 3,822 patients with presurgical evaluation, 2,404 of whom had subsequently undergone surgery . The odds for surgery decreased over time and patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy had lower odds for surgery than patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, but this difference diminished over time . Etiology, the side of the epileptogenic lesion, and invasive recordings influenced the odds for surgery . The most frequent reasons for not undergoing surgery were missing identification of a circumscribed epileptogenic zone or an unacceptable risk of postsurgical deficits in patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy and the patients decision in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy . Compared with patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, the odds for seizure freedom after surgery started lower for patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy in earlier years, but increased . Etiology, age at surgery, and invasive recordings were further predictors for the odds for seizure freedom .

Over the past 28 years, the success of resective surgery for patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy has improved . At the same time, the number of patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy being evaluated for surgery increased, as well as their odds for undergoing surgery .
