seizure outcome after extratemporal lobe epilepsy surgery has often been poorer than after temporal lobe epilepsy surgery
our aim was to analyze the changes in surgical volumes 2 years after surgery for patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy compared with those with temporal lobe epilepsy
our aim was to analyze the changes in seizure outcome 2 years after surgery for patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy compared with those with temporal lobe epilepsy
our aim was to analyze the changes in presurgical volumes 2 years after surgery for patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy compared with those with temporal lobe epilepsy
patients from the bethel presurgicalsurgicalpostsurgical database from 1990 to 2017
our performed a retrospective singlecenter cohort study

factors influencing the odds for surgery
our used logistic regression to analyze factors
our the odds for seizure freedom after surgery
presurgical evaluation 2404 of whom had subsequently undergone surgery
our included 3822 patients with presurgical evaluation
this difference diminished over time
the odds for surgery decreased over time with extratemporal lobe epilepsy had lower odds for surgery than patients with temporal lobe epilepsy
the odds for surgery decreased over patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy had lower odds for surgery than patients with temporal lobe epilepsy
etiology  influenced the odds for surgery
the side of the epileptogenic lesion influenced the odds for surgery
invasive recordings influenced the odds for surgery
the most frequent reasons for not undergoing surgery were missing an unacceptable risk of postsurgical deficits in patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy
the most frequent reasons for not undergoing surgery were missing an unacceptable risk of postsurgical deficits in the patients decision in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy
the most frequent reasons for not undergoing surgery were missing identification of a circumscribed epileptogenic zone in the patients decision in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy
the most frequent reasons for not undergoing surgery were missing identification of a circumscribed epileptogenic zone in patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy
compared with patients with temporal lobe epilepsy the odds for seizure freedom after surgery started lower for patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy in earlier years
compared with patients with temporal lobe epilepsy the odds for seizure freedom after surgery increased
invasive recordings were further predictors for the odds for seizure freedom
etiology age at surgery were further predictors for the odds for seizure freedom
over the past 28 years the success of resective surgery for patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy has improved
extratemporal lobe epilepsy being evaluated for surgery
extratemporal lobe epilepsy being evaluated for surgery odds for undergoing surgery
at the same time the number of patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy increased as well as the number of patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy
