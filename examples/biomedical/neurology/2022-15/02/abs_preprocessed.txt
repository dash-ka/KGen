the boston puerto rican health study is a longitudinal study following selfidentified puerto rican older adults
selfidentified puerto rican older adults living in the greater boston area
studies have shown type 2 diabetes within this ethnic group compared to agematched nonhispanic white adults
studies have shown higher prevalence of hypertension compared to agematched nonhispanic white adults

4 groups based on boston puerto rican health study participants who underwent cognitive testing hypertension
the boston puerto rican health study participants were divided into 4 groups
the boston puerto rican health study participants who underwent cognitive testing
brain age using t1weighted mri
the boston puerto rican health study assessed microstructural integrity of white matter pathways brain macrostructural integrity
brain age
brain macrostructural integrity using hippocampal volumes
brain age using t1weighted cognitive test scores

the boston puerto rican health study results were then compared with results from nonhispanic white from the alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative

the prevalence of hypertension was almost 2 times was 5 times higher in the boston puerto rican health study than in alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative nonhispanic white participants
the prevalence of hypertension was of type 2 diabetes was 5 times higher in the boston puerto rican health study than in alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative nonhispanic white participants
diffusion mri showed group compared to the hypertension
diffusion mri showed clear deterioration patterns in major white matter tracts in the hypertension and type 2 diabetes group and to a lesser extent in type 2 diabetes
diffusion mri showed clear deterioration patterns in major white matter tracts in the hypertension and type 2 diabetes group and to a lesser extent in the hypertension
diffusion mri showed group
diffusion mri showed type 2 diabetes
type 2 diabetes participants also had larger brain aging deviations
hypertension 2 diabetes participants also had larger brain aging deviations
hypertension 2 diabetes participants also had the smallest hippocampal volume
type 2 diabetes participants also had the smallest hippocampal volume

the minimental state examination scores from the hypertension resembled those of alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative white participants with progressive mild cognitive impairment while the the boston puerto rican health study hypertension and type 2 diabetes participants resembled participants with stable mild cognitive impairment
type 2 diabetes the boston puerto rican health study group resembled those of alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative white participants with progressive mild cognitive impairment while the the boston puerto rican health study hypertension and type 2 diabetes participants resembled participants with stable mild cognitive impairment
mri measures resembled those of alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative white participants with progressive mild cognitive impairment while the the boston puerto rican health study hypertension and type 2 diabetes participants resembled participants with stable mild cognitive impairment
the boston puerto rican health study boston was not significantly different from the alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative national alzheimer coordinating center hispanic cohort on minimental state examination measures

the effects of type 2 diabetes led to greater brain structural disruptions than hypertension alone
the effects of hypertension comorbidity led to greater brain structural disruptions than hypertension alone
a key factor contributing to health disparities in cognitive impairment in this group compared to nonhispanic white adults in the same age range
type 2 diabetes in the puerto rican population may be a key factor
the high prevalence of hypertension may be a key factor
