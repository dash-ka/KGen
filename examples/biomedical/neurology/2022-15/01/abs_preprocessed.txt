the neuropathologic changes underlying alzheimer disease start before overt cognitive symptoms
the neuropathologic changes arise
it is not wellknown how overt cognitive symptoms relate to the first subtle cognitive changes
the objective for the prospective biofinder2 study was to examine the independent associations of neurodegeneration with different cognitive domains in cognitively unimpaired individuals
the objective for the prospective biofinder2 study was to examine the independent associations of tau with different cognitive domains in cognitively unimpaired individuals
the objective for the prospective biofinder2 study was to examine the independent associations of the ad hallmarks betaamyloid with different cognitive domains in cognitively unimpaired individuals
in the prospective biofinder2 study cognitively unimpaired participants from the prospective biofinder2 study were included
all had cognitive test data for executive function
all had csf biomarkers for visuospatial function
all had betaamyloidpet for visuospatial function
all had taupet for executive function
all had mri for executive function
all had csf biomarkers for memory
all had mri for memory
all had csf biomarkers for verbal function
all had cognitive test data for visuospatial function
all had mri for verbal function
all had cognitive test data for memory
all had betaamyloidpet for verbal function
all had taupet for memory
all had taupet for visuospatial function
all had csf biomarkers for executive function
all had taupet for verbal function
all had mri for visuospatial function
all had betaamyloidpet for executive function
all had cognitive test data for verbal function
all had betaamyloidpet for memory
multivariable linear regression models were performed using either cortical thickness or betaamyloidpet as predictors of cognitive function
multivariable linear regression models were performed using either cortical thickness as predictors of cognitive function
multivariable linear regression models were performed using either taupet as predictors of cognitive function
multivariable linear regression models were performed using either csf betaamyloid42 ptau181 as predictors of cognitive function
the results were validated in an independent cohort
a total of 316 cognitively unimpaired participants were included from the prospective biofinder2 study
abnormal betaamyloid status was independently associated with the executive measure regardless of modality while tau was independently associated with memory
cortical thickness was independently associated with the executive measure in
cortical thickness was independently associated with verbal fluency models
cortical thickness was independently associated with the executive measure models
cortical thickness was independently associated with verbal fluency in
to examine the relationships in the earliest stage of preclinical alzheimer disease only participants with normal biomarkers of neurodegeneration were included
to examine the relationships in the earliest stage of preclinical alzheimer disease only participants with normal biomarkers of tau were included
again betaamyloid status was associated with executive function
again betaamyloid status was associated with other cognitive domains
the results were overall replicated in the adni cohort
these findings suggest that betaamyloid is independently associated with worse performance on an executive measure
these findings suggest that betaamyloid is independently associated with memory performance
memory performance which instead is associated with tau pathology
ad trials targeting betaamyloid pathology
this may have implications for early preclinical alzheimer disease screening in ad trials
this may have implications for outcome measures in ad trials
