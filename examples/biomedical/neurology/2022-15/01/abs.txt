The neuropathologic changes underlying Alzheimer disease start before overt cognitive symptoms arise, but it is not well-known how they relate to the first subtle cognitive changes . The objective for this study was to examine the independent associations of the AD hallmarks Beta-amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration with different cognitive domains in cognitively unimpaired individuals .

In this cross-sectional study, cognitively unimpaired participants from the prospective BioFINDER-2 study were included . All had CSF biomarkers, MRI, Beta-amyloid-PET, tau-PET, and cognitive test data for memory, executive function, verbal function, and visuospatial function . Multivariable linear regression models were performed using either CSF Beta-amyloid42, p-tau181, and cortical thickness or Beta-amyloid-PET, tau-PET, and cortical thickness as predictors of cognitive function . The results were validated in an independent cohort .

A total of 316 cognitively unimpaired participants were included from the BioFINDER-2 study. Abnormal Beta-amyloid status was independently associated with the executive measure, regardless of modality, while tau was independently associated with memory . Cortical thickness was independently associated with the executive measure and verbal fluency in both models . To examine the relationships in the earliest stage of preclinical Alzheimer disease, only participants with normal biomarkers of tau and neurodegeneration were included . Again, Beta-amyloid status was associated with executive function, but not with other cognitive domains . The results were overall replicated in the ADNI cohort .

These findings suggest that Beta-amyloid is independently associated with worse performance on an executive measure but not with memory performance, which instead is associated with tau pathology . This may have implications for early preclinical Alzheimer disease screening and outcome measures in AD trials targeting Beta-amyloid pathology .
