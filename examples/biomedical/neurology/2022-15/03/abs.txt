To compare maternal obstetric complications and nonelective readmissions in women with common neurologic comorbidities versus women without neurologic disorders .

We performed a retrospective cohort study of index characteristics and acute postpartum, nonelective rehospitalizations from the 2015 to 2017 National Readmissions Database using ICD-10 codes . Wald χ2 testing compared baseline demographic, hospital, and clinical characteristics and postpartum complications between women with common neurologic comorbidities and controls . Multivariable logistic regression models examined odds of postpartum complications and nonelective readmissions within 30 and 90 days for each neurologic comorbidity compared to controls .

A total of 7,612 women with previous stroke, 83,430 women with migraine, 6,760 women with Multiple Sclerosis, 843 women with myasthenia gravis, and 8,136,335 controls met the criteria for index admission after viable infant delivery . women with common neurologic comorbidities were more likely than controls to have inpatient diagnoses of edema, proteinuria, or hypertensive disorders and to have received maternal care for poor fetal growth . The adjusted odds of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention severe maternal morbidity indicator were greater for women with previous stroke, migraine, and myasthenia gravis . Readmission rates at 30 and 90 days for women with common neurologic comorbidities were higher than for controls . Women with myasthenia gravis had the highest adjusted odds of readmission .

women with common neurologic comorbidities may be at higher risk of severe maternal morbidity at the time of index delivery and postpartum readmission . More real-world evidence is needed to develop research infrastructure and create efficacious interventions to optimize maternal–fetal outcomes in women with common neurologic comorbidities, especially for women with previous stroke or myasthenia gravis .
