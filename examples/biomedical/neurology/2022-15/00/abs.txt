Alzheimer disease clinical trials are moving earlier in the disease process according to emerging signs of Beta-amyloid and tau pathology . If early treatment is the right time for intervention, it is critical to find the right test to optimize cognitive outcome measures for clinical trials . We sought to identify cognitive measures associated with the earliest detectable signs of emerging Beta-amyloid and tau pathology .

One hundred twelve clinically normal adults with longitudinal Pittsburgh compound B-PET, 18F-flortaucipir-PET, and cognitive data for over 7 years were included from the Harvard Aging Brain Study . Analyses assessed those initially classified as 18F-flortaucipir and then expanded to include 18F-flortaucipir+ individuals up to CL40, the approximate threshold beyond which neocortical tau proliferation begins . Separate linear mixed-effects models assessed the effects of emerging global Beta-amyloid and tau in the entorhinal and inferior temporal cortices on multiple cognitive tasks and the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite over time .

Steeper 18F-flortaucipir slopes were associated with declining processing speed in those smaller than CL20 and expanded to include learning and memory retrieval in the smaller than CL40 group . A composite measure of processing speed and memory retrieval tasks provided the strongest prediction of decline under CL40, while Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite score remained optimal at high levels of Beta-amyloid .

Early, Beta-amyloid-mediated cognitive slowing was detected for processing speed measures, while early memory retrieval declines were associated with emerging Beta-amyloid and tau pathology . Composites of these measures may help determine whether anti-Beta-amyloid or anti-tau therapies administered at the first signs of pathology might preserve cognitive function .
