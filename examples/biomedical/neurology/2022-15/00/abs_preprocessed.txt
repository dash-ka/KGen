alzheimer disease clinical trials are moving earlier in the disease process according to emerging signs of betaamyloid pathology
alzheimer disease clinical trials are moving earlier in the disease process according to emerging signs of tau pathology
if early treatment is the right time for intervention it is critical to find the right test to optimize cognitive outcome measures for clinical trials
we sought to identify cognitive measures
cognitive measures associated with the earliest detectable signs of emerging betaamyloid
cognitive measures associated with the earliest detectable signs of tau pathology
cognitive data for over 7 years were included from the harvard aging brain study
18fflortaucipirpet were included from the harvard aging brain study
one hundred twelve clinically normal adults with longitudinal pittsburgh compound bpet were included from the harvard aging brain study
analyses initially classified as 18fflortaucipir
analyses assessed those
analyses initially then expanded to include 18fflortaucipir individuals up to cl40
analyses initially then expanded to include 18fflortaucipir individuals up to the approximate threshold
the approximate threshold beyond which neocortical tau proliferation begins
separate linear mixedeffects models assessed the effects of emerging global betaamyloid and tau in the inferior temporal cortices on multiple cognitive tasks
separate linear mixedeffects models assessed the effects of emerging global betaamyloid and tau in the entorhinal temporal cortices on multiple cognitive tasks
separate linear mixedeffects models assessed the effects of emerging global betaamyloid and tau in the preclinical alzheimer cognitive composite over time
steeper 18fflortaucipir slopes were associated with declining processing speed in those smaller than cl20
steeper 18fflortaucipir slopes were expanded to include learning retrieval in the smaller than cl40 group
steeper 18fflortaucipir slopes were expanded to include memory retrieval in the smaller than cl40 group
a composite measure of memory retrieval tasks provided the strongest prediction of decline under cl40 while preclinical alzheimer cognitive composite score remained optimal at high levels of betaamyloid
a composite measure of processing speed provided the strongest prediction of decline under cl40 while preclinical alzheimer cognitive composite score remained optimal at high levels of betaamyloid
early betaamyloidmediated cognitive slowing was detected for processing speed measures while early memory retrieval declines were associated with tau pathology
early betaamyloidmediated cognitive slowing was detected for processing speed measures while early memory retrieval declines were associated with emerging betaamyloid
composites of processing speed measures may help determine whether antitau therapies might preserve cognitive function
