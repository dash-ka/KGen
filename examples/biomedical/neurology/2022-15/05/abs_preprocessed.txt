there is currently no consensus about the extent of gray matter atrophy
gray matter atrophy that can be attributed to secondary changes after the temporal relationships between the 2 phenomena
gray matter atrophy that can be attributed to secondary changes after white matter lesions
gray matter atrophy that can be attributed to secondary changes after the spatial relationships between the 2 phenomena
separating atrophic changes due to primary neurodegenerative mechanisms will then be pivotal to properly evaluate treatment effects especially if these treatments target the different processes individually
elucidating this interplay will broaden the understanding of the combined inflammatory pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis

the overall aim was to clarify the extent how this may differ in the different disease subtypes
the overall aim was to clarify the extent to which white matter lesions are associated with both regional gray matter atrophy
the overall aim was to clarify the extent to which white matter lesions are associated with both global gray matter atrophy
reports containing those significant associations
we searched embase for reports
we searched medline for reports
no restriction was applied for publication date
the quality and risk of bias in included studies were evaluated with the quality assessment tool for observational cohort
the quality and risk of bias in included studies were evaluated with the quality assessment tool for crosssectional studies
qualitative analyses were performed
descriptive analyses were performed
a total of 90 articles were included
those significant associations were almost without exception negative indicating that higher white matter lesion volumes were associated with lower cortical thicknesses
white matter lesion volumes were related mostly to cortical gray matter volumes
white matter lesion volumes were related mostly to deep gray matter volumes
those significant associations were almost without exception negative indicating that higher white matter lesion volumes were associated with lower gray matter volumes
white matter lesion volumes were related mostly to global gray matter volumes
the most consistent relationship between gray matter atrophy was less so in progressive multiple sclerosis
the most consistent relationship between white matter lesions was less so in progressive multiple sclerosis
the most consistent relationship between gray matter atrophy was seen in early disease
the most consistent relationship between white matter lesions was seen in early disease
the findings suggest that gray matter neurodegeneration is mostly secondary to damage in the white matter during early disease stages while becoming more dominated by other possibly primary neurodegenerative disease mechanisms in progressive multiple sclerosis
