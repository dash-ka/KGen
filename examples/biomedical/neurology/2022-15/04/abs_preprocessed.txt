the exact relationship is unclear
cancer may increase the risk of developing guillainbarre syndrome due to molecular mimicry or immunosuppression
we aimed to determine the following risk of guillainbarre syndrome development
we aimed to determine the association between incident cancer
we conducted a nationwide populationbased casecontrol study of all patients with firsttime hospitaldiagnosed guillainbarre syndrome in 10 agematched sexmatched and index datematched population controls per case
we conducted a nationwide populationbased casecontrol study of all patients with firsttime hospitaldiagnosed guillainbarre syndrome in denmark between 2016 per case
we conducted a nationwide populationbased casecontrol study of all patients with firsttime hospitaldiagnosed guillainbarre syndrome in denmark between 1987 per case
we identified incident cancer diagnoses between 6 months before and 2 months after the guillainbarre syndrome index date
we performed stratified analyses to assess the impact of cancer on guillainbarre syndrome risk in strata of sex
we performed stratified analyses to assess the impact of cancer on guillainbarre syndrome risk in strata of age
we used conditional logistic regression to compute odds ratios as a measure of relative risk
we performed stratified analyses to assess the impact of cancer on guillainbarre syndrome risk in strata of calendar periods
survival bias induced by including cancer
in sensitivity analyses to assess any potential risk of survival bias diagnoses potentially made after guillainbarre syndrome diagnosis we examined incident cancers in both a narrower window
in sensitivity analyses to assess any potential risk of survival bias diagnoses potentially made after guillainbarre syndrome diagnosis we examined incident cancers in both a broader exposure window
of 23909 controls included 138 controls had a recent cancer diagnosis
guillainbarre syndrome associated with cancer
of the 2414 patients with guillainbarre syndrome 49 cases had a recent cancer diagnosis
of 23909 controls included 49 cases had a recent cancer diagnosis
a recent cancer diagnosis yielding a matched odd ratio of 36 for guillainbarre syndrome
of the 2414 patients with guillainbarre syndrome 138 controls had a recent cancer diagnosis
stratification by age showed robust results for the association between guillainbarre syndrome with no major variations
stratification by sex showed robust results for the association between cancer syndrome with no major variations
stratification by calendar time showed robust results for the association between guillainbarre syndrome with no major variations
stratification by age showed robust results for the association between cancer syndrome with no major variations
stratification by calendar time showed robust results for the association between cancer syndrome with no major variations
stratification by sex showed robust results for the association between guillainbarre syndrome with no major variations
broadening the exposure window produced slightly weakened associations of or of 24 respectively
narrowing the exposure window produced slightly weakened associations of or of 24 respectively
narrowing the exposure window produced slightly weakened associations of or of 25 respectively
broadening the exposure window produced slightly weakened associations of or of 25 respectively
the guillainbarre syndrome odds ratios were respiratory tract
the guillainbarre syndrome odds ratios were breast cancer
the guillainbarre syndrome odds ratios were highest for cancers of the lymphatic tissue
the guillainbarre syndrome odds ratios were other male genital organ
the guillainbarre syndrome odds ratios were prostate
the guillainbarre syndrome odds ratios were highest for cancers of the hematopoietic tissue
in this large nationwide epidemiologic study incident cancer was associated with a markedly increased risk of subsequent guillainbarre syndrome development
robust results suggest that asyet unidentified factors present in several types of cancer drive the association between guillainbarre syndrome
