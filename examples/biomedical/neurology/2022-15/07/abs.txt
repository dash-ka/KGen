To investigate the association between various medication classes and the periodic limb movement index in a clinical cohort of adults who completed in-laboratory polysomnography .

A single, diagnostic, overnight, in-laboratory polysomnogram was completed for 3,488 patients consecutively referred from 2010 to 2015 to determine periodic limb movement index . Medication use and medical comorbidities were collected through patient questionnaires . Associations between medication classes and periodic limb movement index were ascertained using multivariable ordinal logistic regression models .

The median age of the cohort was 56 years . After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, relevant comorbidities, and sleep measures, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors was associated with increased periodic limb movement index . Conversely, gabapentinoids, stimulants, benzodiazepines, and dopamine agonists were associated with decreased periodic limb movement index . A nonâ€“statistically significant trend for decreased periodic limb movement index with neuroleptic use was observed . No significant associations were found between periodic limb movement index and the use of antihypertensives, statins, tricyclic antidepressants, bupropion, anticoagulants, antiplatelets, modafinil, and antihistamines .

The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors was associated with elevated periodic limb movement index while the use of gabapentinoids, stimulants, benzodiazepines, and dopamine agonists was associated with decreased periodic limb movement index . These results can assist physicians in managing periodic limb movements in sleep and invite further research into the relationship between periodic limb movements in sleep and medications with the modulating effects of dose, formulation type, and time of administration .
