adults who completed inlaboratory polysomnography
to investigate the association between various medication classes in a clinical cohort of adults
to investigate the association between the periodic limb movement index in a clinical cohort of adults
a single diagnostic overnight inlaboratory polysomnogram was completed for 3488 patients consecutively referred from 2010 to 2015 to determine periodic limb movement index
medication use were collected through patient questionnaires
medical comorbidities were collected through patient questionnaires
associations between medication classes were ascertained using multivariable ordinal logistic regression models
associations between periodic limb movement index were ascertained using multivariable ordinal logistic regression models
the median age of the cohort was 56 years
after adjusting for age sex body mass index relevant comorbidities the use of dopamine agonists was associated with increased periodic limb movement index
after adjusting for age sex body mass index relevant comorbidities the use of gabapentinoids stimulants benzodiazepines was associated with increased periodic limb movement index
after sleep measures the use of gabapentinoids stimulants benzodiazepines was associated with increased periodic limb movement index
after sleep measures the use of dopamine agonists was associated with increased periodic limb movement index
conversely gabapentinoids were associated with decreased periodic limb movement index
conversely stimulants were associated with decreased periodic limb movement index
conversely dopamine agonists were associated with decreased periodic limb movement index
conversely benzodiazepines were associated with decreased periodic limb movement index
a nonstatistically significant trend for decreased periodic limb movement index with neuroleptic use was observed
no significant associations were found between the use of modafinil
no significant associations were found between periodic limb movement index
no significant associations were found between the use of antihypertensives
no significant associations were found between the use of tricyclic antidepressants
no significant associations were found between the use of anticoagulants
no significant associations were found between the use of antihistamines
no significant associations were found between the use of bupropion
no significant associations were found between the use of antiplatelets
no significant associations were found between the use of statins
the use of gabapentinoids stimulants benzodiazepines was associated with elevated periodic limb movement index while the use of dopamine agonists was associated with decreased periodic limb movement index
the use of dopamine agonists was associated with elevated periodic limb movement index while the use of gabapentinoids stimulants benzodiazepines was associated with decreased periodic limb movement index
the use of gabapentinoids stimulants benzodiazepines was associated with elevated periodic limb movement index while the use of gabapentinoids stimulants benzodiazepines was associated with decreased periodic limb movement index
the use of dopamine agonists was associated with elevated periodic limb movement index while the use of dopamine agonists was associated with decreased periodic limb movement index
