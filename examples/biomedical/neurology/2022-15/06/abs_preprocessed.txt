lateropulsion is a deficit of active body orientation with respect to gravity in the frontal plane mostly observed after a stroke
lateropulsion magnifies mobility limitations
lateropulsion represents an emerging target in rehabilitation
epidemiology which is insufficient today because many studies have focused on a few severe forms in individuals
individuals called pushers
efforts to design specific interventional studies require some basic knowledge of epidemiology
the objectives of this study were to bridge this gap
original research reporting a prevalence or incidence of poststroke lateropulsion
we systematically searched cinahl up to 31 may 2021 for original research
we systematically searched embase up to 31 may 2021 for original research
we systematically searched medline up to 31 may 2021 for original research
we systematically searched cochrane clinical trials up to 31 may 2021 for original research
we followed moose guidelines
we followed prisma guidelines
eligibility for study quality were evaluated by 2 reviewers
eligibility for inclusion were evaluated by 2 reviewers
2 reviewers who used a standardized protocol
eligibility for data extraction were evaluated by 2 reviewers
the pooled prevalence whose heterogeneity was investigated by subgroup analysis and metaregression
a randomeffects metaanalysis was used to obtain the pooled prevalence
we identified 22 studies most
most published after 2000
the studies quality was adequate with only 8
only 8 showing risk of bias
the pooled lateropulsion prevalence was consistent across assessment tools
the pooled lateropulsion prevalence was 551 percent
after supratentorial stroke lateropulsion prevalence was 41 percent with severe lateropulsion called pushers
after supratentorial stroke lateropulsion prevalence was only 125 percent in individuals with severe lateropulsion called pushers
metaregression did not study quality
metaregression did not reveal any effect of age sex geographic region publication year
lateropulsion prevalence progressively decreased from 528 percent in the acute phase to 37 percent in the early subacute phase
lateropulsion prevalence progressively decreased from 528 percent in the acute phase to 228 percent in the late subacute phase
after infratentorial stroke lateropulsion prevalence was very high reaching 832 percent
poststroke lateropulsion prevalence is high which appeals for poststroke lateropulsion prevalence systematic detection to guide early interventions
uprightness is predominantly controlled from the right hemisphere
