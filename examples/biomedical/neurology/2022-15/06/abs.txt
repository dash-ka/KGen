Lateropulsion is a deficit of active body orientation with respect to gravity in the frontal plane, mostly observed after a stroke . It magnifies mobility limitations and represents an emerging target in rehabilitation . Efforts to design specific interventional studies require some basic knowledge of epidemiology, which is insufficient today because many studies have focused on a few severe forms in individuals called pushers . The objectives of this study were to bridge this gap .

We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Clinical Trials up to 31 May 2021 for original research reporting a prevalence or incidence of poststroke lateropulsion . We followed MOOSE and PRISMA guidelines . Eligibility for inclusion, data extraction, and study quality were evaluated by 2 reviewers who used a standardized protocol . A random-effects meta-analysis was used to obtain the pooled prevalence, whose heterogeneity was investigated by subgroup analysis and metaregression .

We identified 22 studies, most published after 2000 . The studies quality was adequate, with only 8 showing risk of bias . The pooled lateropulsion prevalence was 55.1 percent and was consistent across assessment tools . After supratentorial stroke, lateropulsion prevalence was 41 percent, and only 12.5 percent in individuals with severe lateropulsion, called pushers . Metaregression did not reveal any effect of age, sex, geographic region, publication year, or study quality . Lateropulsion prevalence progressively decreased from 52.8 percent in the acute phase to 37 percent in the early subacute phase and 22.8 percent in the late subacute phase . After infratentorial stroke, lateropulsion prevalence was very high, reaching 83.2 percent .

Poststroke lateropulsion prevalence is high, which appeals for its systematic detection to guide early interventions . Uprightness is predominantly controlled from the right hemisphere .
