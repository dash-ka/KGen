epidemiologic studies have suggested a link between rheumatoid arthritis
epidemiologic studies have suggested a link between parkinson
diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs might explain epidemiologic studies
the aim of this work was to evaluate the association between diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs in persons with rheumatoid arthritis
the aim of this work was to evaluate risk of parkinson in persons with rheumatoid arthritis
this nested nationwide casecontrol study was conducted within the finnish parkinson parkinson cohort
the finnish parkinson parkinson cohort which includes 22189 finnish persons with clinically verified parkinson disease diagnosed from 1996 to 2015
the cases had recorded diagnosis of parkinson in the special reimbursement register
the cases had no exclusion diagnoses with symptoms
symptoms that may be confused with parkinson within 2 years of parkinson disease diagnosis
this nested nationwide casecontrol study included cases with parkinson diagnosed during 1999 to 2015
this nested nationwide casecontrol study included rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed over 3 years before parkinson
rheumatoid arthritis was identified from the finnish care register for special reimbursement register
rheumatoid arthritis was identified from the finnish care register for health care
cases were matched with up to 7 controls by region
cases were matched with up to 7 controls by duration of rheumatoid arthritis
cases were matched with up to 7 controls by age
cases were matched with up to 7 controls by sex
data on purchased prescriptions were identified from the finnish care register since 1995
diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs were categorized into 5 classes
conditional logistic regression adjusted for confounders
associations were studied with conditional logistic regression
altogether 315 cases with 1571 matched controls were included
altogether 315 cases with parkinson were included
the median duration of rheumatoid arthritis on matching date was 116 years for controls
the median duration of rheumatoid arthritis on matching date was 126 years for cases
the majority were women
use of diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs was not associated with risk of parkinson with a 3year lag period applied between outcome except hydroxychloroquine which associated with decreased risk
use of diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs was not associated with risk of parkinson with a 3year lag period applied between exposure except hydroxychloroquine which associated with decreased risk
use of diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs was not associated with risk of parkinson with a 3year lag period applied between outcome except chloroquine which associated with decreased risk
use of diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs was not associated with risk of parkinson with a 3year lag period applied between exposure except chloroquine which associated with decreased risk
immunosuppressants were not associated with parkinson
sulfasalazine were not associated with parkinson
methotrexate were not associated with parkinson
gold preparations were not associated with parkinson
other diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs were not associated with parkinson
our results suggest that the lower risk of parkinson disease in people with rheumatoid arthritis is not explained by diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug use because other diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs did not modify the risk of parkinson among persons with rheumatoid arthritis

association between hydroxychloroquine with lower risk of parkinson should be further investigated
association between hydroxychloroquine with lower risk of the possible underlying mechanisms should be further investigated
association between chloroquine with lower risk of the possible underlying mechanisms should be further investigated
association between chloroquine with lower risk of parkinson should be further investigated
