the atn framework has been developed to categorize biological processes within the alzheimer disease continuum
because alzheimer disease pathology often coincides with dementia with lewy bodies we aimed to investigate the distribution of atn profiles in dementia with lewy bodies with lewy bodies with prognosis
because alzheimer disease pathology often coincides with dementia with lewy bodies we aimed to investigate the distribution of atn profiles in associate atn profiles in dementia with lewy bodies with prognosis
we included 202 patients with dementia with lewy bodies from the amsterdam dementia cohort
the atn framework using csf betaamyloid 42
patients were classified into 8 profiles according to medial temporal atrophy scores
patients were classified into 8 profiles according to the atn framework
patients were classified into 8 profiles according to csf ptau
we compared presence of clinical symptoms in atn profiles
we used linear mixed models to analyze decline on cognitive tests
mortality risk was assessed using cox proportional hazards analysis
analyses were performed on 3
3 clustered categories
analyses were performed on the 8 profiles
fifty patients with dementia with lewy bodies had normal alzheimer disease biomarkers 37 had nonalzheimer disease pathologic change and 115 were classified within the alzheimer disease continuum
atn patients were least often had rem sleep behavior disorder symptoms
atn patients were older often had rem sleep behavior disorder symptoms
parkinsonism was more often present in at compared to at patients
compared to patients with normal alzheimer disease biomarkers patients in a categories showed steeper decline on memory tests
compared to patients with normal alzheimer disease biomarkers patients in a categories showed steeper decline on higher mortality risk
cognitive decline did not differ between normal alzheimer disease biomarkers
mortality did not differ between normal alzheimer disease biomarkers
cognitive decline did not differ between nonalzheimer disease pathologic change
mortality did not differ between nonalzheimer disease pathologic change
in our dementia with lewy bodies cohort our found clinically relevant associations between disease manifestation
in our dementia with lewy bodies cohort our found clinically relevant associations between atn categories
patients within the alzheimer disease continuum had steeper cognitive decline
patients within the alzheimer disease continuum had shorter survival
implementing the atn framework within patients with dementia with lewy bodies aids in subtyping patients could provide targets for future treatment strategies
implementing the atn framework within patients with dementia with lewy bodies aids in subtyping patients based on underlying biological processes
expanding the atn framework by incorporating markers for alphasynucleinopathy would improve the use of the framework to characterize patients with dementia with mixed pathology
mixed pathology which could enhance proper stratification of patients for therapeutic trials
