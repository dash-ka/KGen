Detailed study of tenecteplase in patients older than 80 years is limited . The objective of our study was to assess the safety and efficacy of tenecteplase at 0.25 and 0.40 mg/kg doses in patients older than 80 years with large vessel occlusion .

We performed a pooled analysis of the EXTEND-IA tenecteplase randomized controlled trials . Patients were adults presenting with ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid, middle cerebral, or basilar artery presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom onset . We compared the treatment effect of tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg, tenecteplase 0.40 mg/kg, and alteplase 0.90 mg/kg, stratifying for patient age . Outcomes evaluated include 90-day modified Rankin Scale score, all-cause mortality, and symptomatic ICH . Treatment effect was adjusted for baseline NIH Stroke Score, age, and time from symptom onset to puncture via mixed effects proportional odds and logistic regression models .

In patients older than 80 years, tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg was associated with improved 90-day modified Rankin Scale and reduced mortality vs 0.40 mg/kg . tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg was associated with improved 90-day modified Rankin Scale versus alteplase . No difference in 90-day modified Rankin Scale or mortality was detected between alteplase and tenecteplase 0.40 mg/kg . Symptomatic ICH was observed in 4 patients treated with tenecteplase 0.40 mg/kg, 1 patient treated with alteplase, and 0 patients treated with tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg . In patients younger than 80 years, no differences in 90-day modified Rankin Scale, mortality, or symptomatic ICH were observed among tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg, alteplase, and tenecteplase 0.40 mg/kg .

tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg was associated with improved 90-day modified Rankin Scale and lower mortality in patients older than 80 years . No differences among the doses were observed in younger patients .
