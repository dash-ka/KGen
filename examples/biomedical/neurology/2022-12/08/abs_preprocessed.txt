detailed study of tenecteplase in patients older than 80 years is limited
the objective of our study was to assess the safety and efficacy of tenecteplase at 025 mgkg doses in patients older than 80 years with large vessel occlusion
the objective of our study was to assess the safety and efficacy of tenecteplase at 040 mgkg doses in patients older than 80 years with large vessel occlusion
our performed a pooled analysis of the extendia tenecteplase
our randomized controlled trials
adults presenting with ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid middle cerebral or basilar artery
basilar artery presenting within 45 hours of symptom onset
patients were adults
our compared the treatment effect of tenecteplase 040 mgkg
the treatment effect of tenecteplase 040 mgkg stratifying for patient age
the treatment effect of 090 mgkg stratifying for patient age
our compared the treatment effect of tenecteplase 025 mgkg
the treatment effect of tenecteplase 025 mgkg stratifying for patient age
our compared the treatment effect of 090 mgkg
outcomes evaluated include allbecause mortality
outcomes evaluated include 90day modified rankin scale score
outcomes evaluated include symptomatic ich
treatment effect was adjusted for baseline nih stroke time from symptom onset to puncture via mixed effects logistic regression models
treatment effect was adjusted for baseline nih stroke age from symptom onset to puncture via mixed effects logistic regression models
treatment effect was adjusted for baseline nih stroke score from symptom onset to puncture via mixed effects logistic regression models
treatment effect was adjusted for baseline nih stroke score from symptom onset to puncture via mixed effects proportional odds
treatment effect was adjusted for baseline nih stroke age from symptom onset to puncture via mixed effects proportional odds
treatment effect was adjusted for baseline nih stroke time from symptom onset to puncture via mixed effects proportional odds
in patients older than 80 years tenecteplase 025 mgkg reduced 040 mgkg
in patients older than 80 years tenecteplase 025 mgkg reduced mortality
in patients older than 80 years tenecteplase 025 mgkg was associated with improved 90day
improved 90day modified rankin scale
improved 90day modified rankin scale versus
tenecteplase 025 mgkg was associated with improved 90day alteplase
no difference in 90day was detected between tenecteplase 040 mgkg
90day modified mortality
90day modified rankin scale
no difference in 90day was detected between alteplase
0 patients treated with tenecteplase 025 mgkg
4 patients treated with tenecteplase 040 mgkg
symptomatic ich was observed in 4 patients
symptomatic ich was observed in 1 patient
symptomatic ich was observed in 0 patients
1 patient treated with alteplase
in patients younger than 80 years no differences in 90day were observed among tenecteplase 040 mgkg
90day modified symptomatic ich
90day modified rankin scale
90day modified mortality
in patients younger than 80 years no differences in 90day were observed among tenecteplase 025 mgkg alteplase
tenecteplase 025 mgkg was associated with lower mortality in patients older than 80 years
90day modified rankin scale
tenecteplase 025 mgkg was associated with improved 90day
no differences among the doses were observed in younger patients
