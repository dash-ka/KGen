the objectives of this study were to compare baseline characteristics across cognitive outcome groups
the objectives of this study were to determine whether poor 1year cognitive outcome can be predicted by routinely available baseline clinical variables
the objectives of this study were to establish concurrent validity of a clinically relevant definition of poor cognitive outcome 1 year after mild traumatic brain injury
the objectives of this study were to develop concurrent validity of a clinically relevant definition of poor cognitive outcome 1 year after mild traumatic brain injury
similar healthy controls enrolled in the transforming research
age presenting to level 1 trauma centers within 24 hours of 156 demographically similar healthy controls
similar healthy controls enrolled in clinical knowledge in tbi study
age presenting to level 1 trauma centers within 24 hours of mild traumatic brain injury demographically similar healthy controls
prospective cohort study included 656 participants older than 17 years of age
poor 1year cognitive outcome was defined as cognitive decline
poor 1year cognitive outcome was defined as cognitive impairment
poor 1year cognitive outcome was defined as both
associations of poor 1year cognitive outcome with 1year neurobehavioral outcomes were performed to establish concurrent validity
backward elimination logistic regression was used to build a prediction model
baseline characteristics were compared across cognitive outcome groups
mean age of participants with mild traumatic brain injury was 402 years
poor 1year cognitive outcome was associated with lower satisfaction with life establishing concurrent validity
poor 1year cognitive outcome was associated with worse 1year functional outcome establishing concurrent validity
poor 1year cognitive outcome was associated with more neurobehavioral symptoms greater psychological distress establishing concurrent validity
at 1 year 135 percent of participants with mild traumatic brain injury had a poor cognitive outcome versus 45 percent of controls
in univariable analyses poor 1year cognitive outcome was associated with lack of health insurance
in univariable analyses poor 1year cognitive outcome was associated with nonwhite race
in univariable analyses poor 1year cognitive outcome was associated with lower income
in univariable analyses poor 1year cognitive outcome was associated with preinjury depression
in univariable analyses poor 1year cognitive outcome was associated with greater injury severity
in univariable analyses poor 1year cognitive outcome was associated with hyperglycemia
in univariable analyses poor 1year cognitive outcome was associated with lower education
the final multivariable prediction model included rotterdam ct score greater than 3 and achieved an area under the curve of 069 for the prediction of a poor 1year cognitive outcome with each variable
the final multivariable prediction model included education and achieved an area under the curve of 069 for the prediction of a poor 1year cognitive outcome with each variable
each variable associated with over 2fold increased odds of poor 1year cognitive outcome
the final multivariable prediction model included hyperglycemia and achieved an area under the curve of 069 for the prediction of a poor 1year cognitive outcome with each variable
the final multivariable prediction model included preinjury depression and achieved an area under the curve of 069 for the prediction of a poor 1year cognitive outcome with each variable
the final multivariable prediction model included health insurance and achieved an area under the curve of 069 for the prediction of a poor 1year cognitive outcome with each variable
poor 1year cognitive outcome is common affecting 135 percent of patients with mild traumatic brain injury versus 45 percent of controls
poor 1year cognitive outcome highlight the need for better understanding of mechanisms
mechanisms underlying poor cognitive outcome after mild traumatic brain injury to inform interventions to optimize cognitive recovery
