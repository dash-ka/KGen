To correlate brain metabolites with clinical outcome using magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients undergoing targeted temperature management after cardiac arrest and assess their relationships to MRI and EEG variables .

A prospective cohort of 50 patients was studied . The primary outcome was coma recovery to follow commands . Comparison of magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures in the posterior cingulate gyrus, parietal white matter, basal ganglia, and brainstem were also made to 25 normative controls .

Fourteen of 50 patients achieved coma recovery before hospital discharge . There was a significant decrease in total N-acetylaspartate and an increase in lactate and creatine in patients who did not recover, with changes most prominent in the posterior cingulate gyrus . Patients who recovered had decrease in N-acetylaspartate as compared to controls . N-acetylaspartate had a strong monotonic relationship with MRI cortical apparent diffusion coefficient . Lactate level exponentially increased with decreasing Aapparent diffusion coefficient . EEG suppression and burst suppression was strongly associated with Lactate elevation .

NAA and Lactate changes are associated with clinical, MRI, and EEG changes consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and are most prominent in the posterior cingulate gyrus . N-acetylaspartate decrease observed in patients with good outcomes suggests mild  hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in patients asymptomatic at hospital discharge . The appearance of cortical Lac represents a deterioration of aerobic energy metabolism and is associated with EEG background suppression, synaptic transmission failure, and severe, potentially irreversible  hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy .
