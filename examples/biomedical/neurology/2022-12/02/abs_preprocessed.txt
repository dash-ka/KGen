a prospective cohort of 50 patients was studied
the primary outcome was coma recovery to follow commands
comparison of magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures in basal ganglia were also made to 25 normative controls
comparison of magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures in the posterior cingulate gyrus were also made to 25 normative controls
comparison of magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures in parietal white matter were also made to 25 normative controls
comparison of magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures in brainstem were also made to 25 normative controls
fourteen of 50 patients achieved coma recovery before hospital discharge
there was an increase in creatine in patients
there was a significant decrease in total nacetylaspartate in patients
patients who did not recover with changes most prominent in the posterior cingulate gyrus
there was an increase in lactate in patients
patients who recovered
patients had decrease in nacetylaspartate as compared to controls
nacetylaspartate had a strong monotonic relationship with mri cortical apparent diffusion coefficient
lactate level exponentially increased with decreasing aapparent diffusion coefficient
eeg suppression was strongly associated with lactate elevation
burst suppression was strongly associated with lactate elevation
lactate changes are associated with eeg changes consistent with hypoxicischemic encephalopathy
naa changes are most prominent in the posterior cingulate gyrus
naa changes are associated with clinical mri consistent with hypoxicischemic encephalopathy
lactate changes are associated with clinical mri consistent with hypoxicischemic encephalopathy
lactate changes are most prominent in the posterior cingulate gyrus
naa changes are associated with eeg changes consistent with hypoxicischemic encephalopathy
nacetylaspartate decrease suggests mild hypoxicischemic encephalopathy in patients asymptomatic at hospital discharge
nacetylaspartate decrease observed in patients with good outcomes
the appearance of cortical lac is associated with synaptic transmission failure
the appearance of cortical lac is associated with severe potentially irreversible hypoxicischemic encephalopathy
the appearance of cortical lac is associated with eeg background suppression
the appearance of cortical lac represents a deterioration of aerobic energy metabolism
