Disorders of consciousness, EEG background suppression, and epileptic seizures are associated with poor outcome after cardiac arrest . Our objective was to identify the distribution of diffusion MRIâ€“measured anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest and to define the regional correlates of disorders of consciousness, EEG background suppression, and seizures .

We analyzed patients from a single-center database of unresponsive patients who underwent diffusion MRI after cardiac arrest . We classified each patient according to recovery of consciousness before discharge, the most continuous EEG background, and the presence or absence of seizures . Anoxic brain injury was measured with the apparent diffusion coefficient signal . We identified apparent diffusion coefficient abnormalities relative to controls without cardiac arrest and used voxel lesion symptom mapping to identify regional associations with disorders of consciousness, EEG background suppression, and seizures . We then used a bootstrapped lasso regression procedure to identify robust, multivariate regional associations with each outcome variable . Last, using area under receiver operating characteristic curves, we then compared the classification ability of the strongest regional associations to that of brain-wide summary measures .

Compared to controls, patients with cardiac arrest demonstrated apparent diffusion coefficient signal reduction that was most significant in the occipital lobes . Disorders of consciousness were associated with reduced apparent diffusion coefficient most prominently in the occipital lobes but also in deep structures . Regional injury more accurately classified patients with disorders of consciousness than whole-brain injury . Background suppression mapped to a similar set of brain regions, but regional injury could no better classify patients than whole-brain measures . Seizures were less common in patients with more severe anoxic injury, particularly in those with injury to the lateral temporal white matter .

Anoxic brain injury was most prevalent in posterior cerebral regions, and this regional pattern of injury was a better predictor of disorders of consciousness than whole-brain injury measures . EEG background suppression lacked a specific regional association, but patients with injury to the temporal lobe were less likely to have seizures . Regional patterns of anoxic brain injury are relevant to the clinical and electrographic sequelae of cardiac arrest and may hold importance for prognosis .
