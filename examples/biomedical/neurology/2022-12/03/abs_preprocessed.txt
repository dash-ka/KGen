disorders of eeg background suppression are associated with poor outcome after cardiac arrest
disorders of epileptic seizures are associated with poor outcome after cardiac arrest
disorders of consciousness are associated with poor outcome after cardiac arrest
our objective was to define the regional correlates of disorders of eeg background suppression
our objective was to identify the distribution of diffusion mrimeasured anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest
our objective was to define the regional correlates of disorders of seizures
our objective was to define the regional correlates of disorders of consciousness
our analyzed patients from a singlecenter database of unresponsive patients
unresponsive patients who underwent diffusion mri after cardiac arrest
our classified each patient according to recovery of consciousness before discharge the most continuous eeg background
our classified each patient according to recovery of consciousness before discharge the presence or absence of seizures
anoxic brain injury was measured with the apparent diffusion coefficient signal
we identified apparent diffusion coefficient abnormalities used voxel lesion symptom
voxel lesion symptom mapping to identify regional associations with disorders of eeg background suppression
voxel lesion symptom mapping to identify regional associations with disorders of seizures
we identified apparent diffusion coefficient abnormalities relative to controls without cardiac arrest
voxel lesion symptom mapping to identify regional associations with disorders of consciousness
a bootstrapped lasso regression procedure to identify robust multivariate regional associations with each outcome variable
we then used a
last using area under receiver operating characteristic curves
last we then compared the classification ability of the strongest regional associations to that of brainwide summary measures
apparent diffusion coefficient signal reduction that was most significant in the occipital lobes
compared to controls patients with cardiac arrest demonstrated apparent diffusion coefficient signal reduction
disorders of consciousness were associated with reduced apparent diffusion coefficient most prominently in the occipital lobes
disorders of consciousness were associated with reduced apparent diffusion coefficient also in deep structures
regional injury more accurately classified patients with disorders of consciousness than wholebrain injury
background suppression mapped to a similar set of brain regions
regional injury could no better classify patients than wholebrain measures
seizures were less common in patients with more severe anoxic injury particularly in those with injury to the lateral temporal white matter
anoxic brain injury was most prevalent in posterior cerebral regions
this regional pattern of injury was a better predictor of disorders of consciousness than wholebrain injury measures
eeg background suppression lacked a specific regional association
patients with injury to the temporal lobe were less likely to have seizures
regional patterns of anoxic brain injury are relevant to the clinical sequelae of cardiac arrest
regional patterns of anoxic brain injury may hold importance for prognosis
regional patterns of anoxic brain injury are relevant to the electrographic sequelae of cardiac arrest
