multiple factors have been found to contribute to the high risk of epilepsy in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex including evolution of mri characteristics
multiple factors have been found to contribute to the high risk of epilepsy in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex including evolution of tuberous sclerosis complex gene variant
multiple factors have been found to contribute to the high risk of epilepsy in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex including evolution of eeg abnormalities
the aim of this prospective multicenter study was to identify early mri biomarkers of epilepsy in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex and associate these mri biomarkers with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age
the aim of this prospective multicenter study was before seizure onset and associate these mri biomarkers with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age
tuberous sclerosis complex aged less than 6 months
this prospective multicenter study was part of the epistop project
we evaluated brain mris
brain mris performed in infants younger than 6 months with tuberous sclerosis complex
we used harmonized mri protocols across children were monitored closely with neuropsychological evaluation
we used harmonized mri protocols across children were monitored closely with serial video eeg
we used harmonized mri protocols across centers were monitored closely with neuropsychological evaluation
we used harmonized mri protocols across centers were monitored closely with serial video eeg
mri characteristics defined as subependymal giant cell astrocytoma
mri characteristics defined as tubers
mri characteristics defined as calcifications
mri characteristics defined as subependymal nodules
lesions were detected semiautomatically
mri characteristics defined as white matter abnormalities
mri characteristics defined as radial migration lines
mri characteristics defined as cysts
mri characteristics were visually evaluated
lesion to brain volume ratios were associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years
lesion to brain volume ratios were calculated with epilepsy outcomes at 2 years
lesion to brain volume ratios were associated with epilepsy outcomes at 2 years
lesion to brain volume ratios were calculated with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years
lesions were assessed on mris from 77 infants with tuberous sclerosis complex
62 mris were sufficient for volume analysis
the presence of higher tuberbrain ratios were associated with the development of clinical seizures independently of tuberous sclerosis complex gene variation
the presence of higher tuberbrain ratios were associated with the development of clinical seizures independently of preventive treatment
the presence of tubers were associated with the development of clinical seizures independently of tuberous sclerosis complex gene variation
the presence of tubers were associated with the development of clinical seizures independently of preventive treatment
furthermore higher tuberbrain ratios were associated with lower cognitive quotients at 2 years independently of tuberous sclerosis complex gene variation and presence of epilepsy
furthermore higher tuberbrain ratios were associated with motor development quotients at 2 years independently of tuberous sclerosis complex gene variation and presence of epilepsy
characteristic tuberous sclerosis complex lesions detected on neurodevelopmental outcomes in the first 2 years of life
characteristic tuberous sclerosis complex lesions detected on early brain mri
characteristic tuberous sclerosis complex lesions detected on development of clinical seizures
in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex there is a significant association between characteristic tuberous sclerosis complex lesions
according to our results early brain mri findings may guide clinical care for young children with tuberous sclerosis complex
