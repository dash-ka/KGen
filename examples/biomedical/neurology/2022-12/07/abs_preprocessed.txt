sudomotor impairment has been recognized as a key feature in differentiating parkinson with patients in late stage of disease
we aimed to evaluate morphologic postganglionic sudomotor involvement in patients with newly diagnosed multiple system atrophyparkinsonian type
we aimed to evaluate functional postganglionic sudomotor involvement in patients with newly diagnosed multiple system atrophyparkinsonian type
we aimed to evaluate functional postganglionic sudomotor involvement in patients with newly diagnosed multiple system parkinson disease to identify possible biomarkers in differentiating the 2 conditions in the early stage
possible biomarkers that might be of help
we aimed to evaluate morphologic postganglionic sudomotor involvement in patients with newly diagnosed multiple system parkinson disease to identify possible biomarkers in differentiating the 2 conditions in the early stage
one hundred patients with parkinsonism within 2 years from onset of motor symptoms were included in the study
at the time of recruitment
questionnaires to assess nonmotor autonomic were administered
patients punch skin biopsy from the distal leg
questionnaires to assess small fiber symptoms were administered
patients underwent postganglionic sudomotor function assessment by the dynamic sweat test
skin samples were processed for indirect immunofluorescence with a panel of antibodies including noradrenergic markers
skin samples were processed for indirect immunofluorescence with a panel of antibodies including cholinergic markers
the density of intraepidermal was measured on confocal images with dedicated software
the density of pilomotor nerve fibers was measured on confocal images with dedicated software
the density of sudomotor was measured on confocal images with dedicated software
a followup visit 12 months after recruitment was performed to confirm the diagnosis
we recruited 57 patients with parkinson with multiple system atrophyparkinsonian type
we recruited 57 patients with 43 patients with multiple system atrophyparkinsonian type
clinical scales and questionnaires showed a more severe clinical picture in patients with multiple system atrophyparkinsonian type compared to those with parkinson
sweating output and intraepidermal pilomotor and sudomotor nerve densities compared to controls were lower in both groups atrophyparkinsonian type
sweating output and intraepidermal pilomotor and sudomotor nerve densities compared to controls were lower with a greater impairment in patients with multiple system atrophyparkinsonian type
sudomotor nerve density correlated with sweating function
pilomotor correlated with sweating function
pilomotor correlated with nonmotor clinical symptoms
sudomotor nerve density correlated with nonmotor clinical symptoms
sweat production multiplied by the density of sudomotor
a composite sudomotor parameter defined as the arithmetic product of sweat production
a composite sudomotor parameter fibers efficiently separated the 2 populations
the receiver operating characteristics curve showed an area under the curve of 083
dynamic sweat test proved to be a sensitive morphofunctional approach to assess the postganglionic component of the sudomotor pathway revealing a more severe involvement in multiple system atrophyparkinsonian type than in parkinson disease early in the disease course
dynamic sweat the quantification of cutaneous autonomic nerves proved to be a sensitive morphofunctional approach to assess the postganglionic component of the sudomotor pathway revealing a more severe involvement in multiple system atrophyparkinsonian type than in parkinson disease early in the disease course
a sensitive morphofunctional approach to assess the postganglionic component of the sudomotor pathway can be applied to differentiate the 2 conditions early
