it is uncertain whether this could offset the high costs related to surgery
improvement in seizure control after epilepsy surgery could lead to lower health care resource use and costs
this study aimed to evaluate phasespecific longterm health care costs of surgery compared to medical therapy in children with drugresistant epilepsy from the health care payer perspective
this study aimed to evaluate cumulative longterm health care costs of surgery compared to medical therapy in children with drugresistant epilepsy from the health care payer perspective
children were identified from chart review
children who were treated with medical therapy from 2003 to 2018 at the hospital for sick children in toronto
children who were treated with surgery therapy from 2003 to 2018 at the hospital for sick children in toronto health administrative databases in ontario canada
children who were evaluated for epilepsy surgery
children who were evaluated for epilepsy surgery
children were linked to children
children who were treated with surgery from 2003 to 2018 at the hospital for sick children in toronto
children who were treated with medical therapy from 2003 to 2018 at the hospital for sick children in toronto health administrative databases in ontario canada
inverse probability of treatment weighting with stabilized weights was used to balance the baseline covariates between the 2 groups
patients were assigned to shortterm on the basis of treatment trajectory
patients were assigned to longterm postsurgery care phases on the basis of treatment trajectory
patients were assigned to surgery on the basis of treatment trajectory
patients were assigned to presurgery on the basis of treatment trajectory
patients were assigned to intermediateterm on the basis of treatment trajectory
cumulative longterm health care costs were evaluated
phasespecific longterm health care costs were evaluated
costs were converted from canadian to us dollars year 2018 value
there were 372 surgical
there were 258 medical patients
costs were higher in surgical than medical patients for surgery
costs were higher in surgical than medical patients for presurgery
costs were higher in surgical than medical patients for shortterm care phase
costs were lower in surgical patients for longterm care phase
costs were lower in surgical patients for intermediateterm
in surgical patients costs were highest for surgery
surgery followed by presurgery care phase with hospitalizations
hospitalizations accounting for the highest cost component
in medical patients costs increased gradually from presurgery to longterm care phase
from 8 years on costs were lower for surgical patients
cumulative costs were higher for surgical than medical patients in the first 7 years after surgery
this study demonstrated the longterm economic benefits of epilepsy surgery compared to medical therapy for the health care system with the use of realworld data
realworld data which would justify the high costs of surgery
future economic evaluation comparing minimally invasive treatment such as laser therapy to surgery
this study will support future economic evaluation
