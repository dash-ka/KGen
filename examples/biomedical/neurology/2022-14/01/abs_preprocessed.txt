limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change is present in about 25 percent of older persons brains
limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change is strongly associated with cognitive impairment
the pathologic correlates of hippocampal sclerosis in limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change are not well understood
hippocampal sclerosis pathology is often comorbid with limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change
the clinical correlates of hippocampal sclerosis in limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change are not well understood
the national alzheimer coordinating center neuropathology data set which included neurologic status
data derived from the national alzheimer coordinating center neuropathology data set
the national alzheimer coordinating center neuropathology data set which included medical histories
the national alzheimer coordinating center neuropathology data set which included neuropathologic results
this retrospective autopsy cohort study used data
all autopsies were performed in 2014 or later
among participants with limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change those were compared with those without hippocampal sclerosis with regard to common underlying diseases
those who also had hippocampal sclerosis pathology
among participants with limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change those were compared with those without hippocampal sclerosis with regard to candidate risk factors
a total of 408 participants were included
the included limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change participants
most of the were severely impaired cognitively
compared to hippocampal sclerosis participants limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change participants with hippocampal sclerosis scored lower on orientation domains
compared to hippocampal sclerosis participants limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change participants with hippocampal sclerosis scored lower on the personal care
compared to hippocampal sclerosis participants limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change participants with hippocampal sclerosis trended toward having worse cognitive status
among limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change participants with braak neurofibrillary tangle stages 0 to iv the hippocampal sclerosis group were more impaired in the orientation domains
among limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change participants with braak neurofibrillary tangle stages 0 to iv the hippocampal sclerosis group were more impaired in the memory domains
there were no differences in the proportion with clinical histories of diabetes
there were no differences in the proportion with clinical histories of cardiac bypass procedures
there were no differences in the proportion with clinical histories of hypertension
there were no differences in the proportion with clinical histories of seizures
there were no differences in the proportion with clinical histories of stroke
the hippocampal sclerosis group lacking tar dna binding protein
the hippocampal sclerosis group 43 proteinopathy was relatively likely to have had strokes
when limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change participants with or without hippocampal sclerosis were compared there were no differences in lewy body pathologies
when limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change participants with or without hippocampal sclerosis were compared there were no differences in alzheimer disease neuropathologies
however the hippocampal sclerosis group hippocampal was more likely to have neocortical tar dna binding protein 43 proteinopathy
however the hippocampal sclerosis group hippocampal was less likely to have amygdalarestricted tar dna binding protein 43 proteinopathy
limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change brains with hippocampal sclerosis also tended to have more severe circle of arteriolosclerosis pathologies
limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change brains with hippocampal sclerosis also tended to have more severe circle of willis atherosclerosis
in this cohort skewed toward participants with severe dementia limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change hippocampal sclerosis pathology was not associated with seizures
in this cohort skewed toward participants with severe dementia limbicpredominant agerelated tar dna binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change hippocampal sclerosis pathology was not associated with alzheimertype pathologies
rather the presence of comorbid hippocampal sclerosis pathology was associated with more widespread tar dna binding protein 43 proteinopathy and with more severe nonbetaamyloid vessel wall pathologies
