early consciousness disorder after acute ischemic stroke is understudied
early consciousness disorder may influence outcomes to withdraw lifesustaining treatment
early consciousness disorder may influence the decision to withhold lifesustaining treatment
early consciousness disorder may influence outcomes to withhold lifesustaining treatment
early consciousness disorder may influence the decision to withdraw lifesustaining treatment
we studied patients with acute ischemic stroke from 2010 to 2019 across 122 hospitals
122 hospitals participating in the florida stroke registry
we studied withholding of lifesustaining treatment
we studied ambulation status on discharge
we studied discharge disposition
we studied withdrawal of lifesustaining treatment
we studied hospital length of stay
we studied the effect of early consciousness disorder on inhospital mortality
of 238989 patients with acute ischemic stroke 32861 had early consciousness disorder at stroke presentation
18 percent were black
overall
63 percent were white
14 percent were hispanic
average age was 72 years
49 percent were women
compared to patients without early consciousness disorder patients with early consciousness disorder had greater inhospital mortality
compared to patients without early consciousness disorder patients with early consciousness disorder had more comorbidities
compared to patients without early consciousness disorder patients with early consciousness disorder had greater stroke severity as assessed by the national institutes of health stroke scale
compared to patients without early consciousness disorder patients with early consciousness disorder were older
compared to patients without early consciousness disorder patients with early consciousness disorder were more often female
compared to patients without early consciousness disorder patients with early consciousness disorder had higher withdrawal of lifesustaining treatment rates
using adjusted models accounting for basic characteristics patients with early consciousness disorder had longer hospitalization to rehabilitation
using adjusted models accounting for basic characteristics patients with early consciousness disorder had longer hospitalization were less likely to be discharged home
using adjusted models accounting for basic characteristics patients with early consciousness disorder had greater inhospital mortality
using adjusted models accounting for basic characteristics patients with early consciousness disorder were less likely to ambulate independently
withdrawal of lifesustaining treatment significantly mediated the effect of early consciousness disorder on mortality
in temporal trend analysis we found a significant decrease in early withdrawal of lifesustaining treatment in late withdrawal of lifesustaining treatment
in temporal trend analysis we found a significant decrease in early withdrawal of an increase in late withdrawal of lifesustaining treatment
in this large prospective multicenter stroke registry patients with acute ischemic stroke had greater mortality
in this large prospective multicenter stroke registry patients with acute ischemic stroke had worse discharge outcomes
acute ischemic stroke presenting with early consciousness disorder
mortality was largely influenced by the withdrawal of lifesustaining treatment decision
