small iatrogenic brain infarcts are often seen on diffusionweighted mri following surgical procedures
small iatrogenic brain infarcts are often seen on diffusionweighted mri following endovascular procedures
there are few data on small iatrogenic brain infarcts clinical effects
patients undergoing endovascular repair of intracranial aneurysms
we examined the association of iatrogenic infarcts with outcomes in the enact randomized controlled trial of nerinetide in patients
in this post hoc analysis we used multivariable models to evaluate the association of the number of iatrogenic infarcts on diffusionweighted mri with cognitive outcomes at 14 days postprocedure
in this post hoc analysis we used multivariable models to evaluate the association of the number of iatrogenic infarcts on diffusionweighted mri with neuropsychiatric outcomes at 14 days postprocedure
in this post hoc analysis we used multivariable models to evaluate the association of the 30 days postprocedure
in this post hoc analysis we used multivariable models to evaluate the association of the presence of iatrogenic infarcts on diffusionweighted mri with neuropsychiatric outcomes at 14 days postprocedure
in this post hoc analysis we used multivariable models to evaluate the association of the presence of iatrogenic infarcts on diffusionweighted mri with functional status postprocedure
in this post hoc analysis we used multivariable models to evaluate the association of the number of iatrogenic infarcts on diffusionweighted mri with functional status postprocedure
in this post hoc analysis we used multivariable models to evaluate the association of the presence of iatrogenic infarcts on diffusionweighted mri with neurologic impairment postprocedure
in this post hoc analysis we used multivariable models to evaluate the association of the number of iatrogenic infarcts on diffusionweighted mri with neurologic impairment postprocedure
in this post hoc analysis we used multivariable models to evaluate the association of the presence of iatrogenic infarcts on diffusionweighted mri with cognitive outcomes at 14 days postprocedure
we also related infarct number to a z scorederived composite outcome score
related infarct number to a z scorederived composite outcome score using quantile regression
among 184 patients 124 had postprocedural diffusionweighted mri lesions
nerinetide treatment was associated with no overall significant clinical treatment effects
nerinetide treatment was associated with fewer iatrogenic infarcts
iatrogenic brain infarcts were associated with subtle differences in 30day outcomes on different measures in this middleaged cohort with earlier dysfunction
earlier dysfunction correlating with later differences
iatrogenic brain infarcts were associated with subtle differences in postprocedural outcomes on different measures in this middleaged cohort with earlier dysfunction
