Small iatrogenic brain infarcts are often seen on diffusion-weighted MRI following surgical or endovascular procedures, but there are few data on their clinical effects . We examined the association of iatrogenic infarcts with outcomes in the ENACT randomized controlled trial of nerinetide in patients undergoing endovascular repair of intracranial aneurysms .

In this post hoc analysis, we used multivariable models to evaluate the association of the presence and number of iatrogenic infarcts on diffusion-weighted MRI with neurologic impairment, functional status, and cognitive and neuropsychiatric outcomes at 1–4 days and 30 days postprocedure . We also related infarct number to a z score–derived composite outcome score using quantile regression .

Among 184 patients, 124 had postprocedural diffusion-weighted MRI lesions . Nerinetide treatment was associated with fewer iatrogenic infarcts but no overall significant clinical treatment effects .

Iatrogenic brain infarcts were associated with subtle differences in postprocedural and 30-day outcomes on different measures in this middle-aged cohort, with earlier dysfunction correlating with later differences .
