Spinal cord sarcoidosis is a rare manifestation of sarcoidosis with a consequent risk of neurologic sequelae for the patient . We investigated prognostic factors and efficacy of immunosuppressive treatments in a longitudinal cohort .

We retrospectively studied patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis followed between 1995 and 2021 in 7 centers in France . Patients with definite, probable, or possible spinal cord sarcoidosis according to the Neurosarcoidosis Consortium Consensus Group criteria and with spinal cord involvement confirmed by MRI were included . We analyzed relapse or progression rate with a Poisson model, initial Rankin score with a linear model, and change in the Rankin score during follow-up with a logistic model .

A total of 97 patients were followed for a median of 7.8 years . Overall mean relapse or progression rate was 0.17 per person-year and decreased over time . At last visit, 46 patients had a loss of autonomy . The main prognostic factors significantly associated with relapse or progression rate were gadolinium enhancement or meningeal involvement on spinal cord MRI and cell count on CSF analysis . Relapse or progression rate was not significantly associated with initial Rankin score or Expanded Disability Status Scale . Tumor necrosis factor–alpha antagonists significantly decreased relapse or progression rate compared with corticosteroids alone . Azathioprine was significantly less effective than methotrexate on relapse or progression rate  and change in Rankin score .

Regarding the relapse or progression rate, meningeal localization of sarcoidosis was associated with a worse prognosis, Tumor necrosis factor–alpha antagonists resulted in a significant decrease compared to corticosteroids alone, and methotrexate was more effective than azathioprine .
