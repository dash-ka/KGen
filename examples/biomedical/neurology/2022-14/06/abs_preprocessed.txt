spinal cord sarcoidosis is a rare manifestation of sarcoidosis with a consequent risk of neurologic sequelae for the patient
we investigated prognostic factors and efficacy of immunosuppressive treatments in a longitudinal cohort
we retrospectively studied patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis followed between 1995 in 7 centers in france
we retrospectively studied patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis followed between 2021 in 7 centers in france
patients with definite possible spinal cord sarcoidosis according to the neurosarcoidosis consortium consensus group criteria were included
spinal cord involvement confirmed by mri
patients with definite probable spinal cord sarcoidosis according to the neurosarcoidosis consortium consensus group criteria were included
patients with spinal cord involvement were included
we analyzed change in the rankin score during followup with a logistic model
we analyzed progression rate with a poisson model during followup with a logistic model
we analyzed initial rankin score with a linear model during followup with a logistic model
we analyzed relapse rate with a poisson model during followup with a logistic model
a total of 97 patients were followed for a median of 78 years
progression rate was 017 per personyear
overall mean relapse decreased over time
progression rate decreased over time
overall mean relapse was 017 per personyear
at last visit 46 patients had a loss of autonomy
the main prognostic factors significantly associated with progression rate were meningeal involvement on spinal cord mri
the main prognostic factors significantly associated with relapse rate were gadolinium enhancement on spinal cord mri
the main prognostic factors significantly associated with progression rate were cell count on csf analysis
the main prognostic factors significantly associated with progression rate were gadolinium enhancement on spinal cord mri
the main prognostic factors significantly associated with relapse rate were meningeal involvement on spinal cord mri
the main prognostic factors significantly associated with relapse rate were cell count on csf analysis
relapse rate was not significantly associated with initial rankin score
relapse rate was not significantly associated with expanded disability status scale
progression rate was not significantly associated with initial rankin score
progression rate was not significantly associated with expanded disability status scale
tumor necrosis factoralpha antagonists significantly decreased relapse rate compared with corticosteroids alone
tumor necrosis factoralpha antagonists significantly decreased progression rate compared with corticosteroids alone
azathioprine was significantly less effective than methotrexate on relapse rate
azathioprine was significantly less effective than change in rankin score
azathioprine was significantly less effective than methotrexate on progression rate
regarding the progression rate meningeal localization of sarcoidosis was associated with a worse prognosis tumor necrosis factoralpha antagonists resulted in a significant decrease compared to corticosteroids alone and methotrexate was more effective than azathioprine
regarding the relapse rate meningeal localization of sarcoidosis was associated with a worse prognosis tumor necrosis factoralpha antagonists resulted in a significant decrease compared to corticosteroids alone and methotrexate was more effective than azathioprine
