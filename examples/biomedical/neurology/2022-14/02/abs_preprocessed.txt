for disease monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases reliable blood biomarkers are needed
for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases reliable blood biomarkers are needed
elevated levels of neurofilament light chain protein  have been described across different neurodegenerative diseases with highest values in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
an axonal damage marker have been described across different neurodegenerative diseases with highest values in prion diseases

synaptic degeneration is a common early feature in most neurodegenerative diseases
synaptic degeneration seems to precede neuronal degeneration in prion disease
however synaptic markers in blood are still missing
here we investigated whether the brainspecific protein betasynuclein might be a suitable blood biomarker for early diagnosis and evaluation of synaptic integrity in prion disease
we analyzed the brainspecific protein betasynuclein with a newly established digital elisa and neurofilament light chain protein with a singlemolecule array in samples obtained from human participants and prion and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis animal models
furthermore betasynuclein was investigated in brain tissue of individuamyotrophic lateral sclerosis with creutzfeldtjakob disease and controls
we investigated 308 patients including 129 cases with 8 presymptomatic prnp variation carriers
we investigated 308 patients including 129 cases with 43 control patients
we investigated 308 patients including 129 cases with 60 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
we investigated 308 patients including 129 cases with 68 with other neurodegenerative diseases
we investigated 308 patients including 129 cases with prion disease
in creutzfeldtjakob disease symptomatic cases light chain protein were markedly increased compared to all other diagnostic groups
in betasynuclein light chain protein were markedly increased compared to all other diagnostic groups
in neurofilament light chain protein were markedly increased compared to all other diagnostic groups
in the large majority of presymptomatic prnp variation carriers betasynuclein light chain protein levels were within normal ranges
in the large majority of presymptomatic prnp variation carriers neurofilament light chain protein levels were within normal ranges
in prion disease animal models betasynuclein light chain protein displayed normal levels in the presymptomatic phase with a plateau in the symptomatic phase
in prion disease animal models betasynuclein light chain protein displayed normal levels in the presymptomatic phase with a sudden elevation at disease onset
in prion disease animal models neurofilament light chain protein displayed normal levels in the presymptomatic phase with a plateau in the symptomatic phase
in prion disease animal models neurofilament light chain protein displayed normal levels in the presymptomatic phase with a sudden elevation at disease onset
in contrast to neurofilament light chain protein betasynuclein was not elevated in either an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis animal model
in contrast to neurofilament light chain protein betasynuclein was not elevated in either symptomatic patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
in the discrimination between prion disease betasynuclein was superior to neurofilament light chain protein
in the discrimination between all other groups betasynuclein was superior to neurofilament light chain protein
in addition the brainspecific protein betasynuclein showed significantly reduced levels in patients with creutzfeldtjakob disease
creutzfeldtjakob disease compared to control patients
the brainspecific protein betasynuclein showed good discriminative characteristics
the brainspecific protein betasynuclein was significantly elevated in patients with creutzfeldtjakob disease reflecting ongoing synaptic damage
we therefore propose the brainspecific protein betasynuclein as a candidate blood marker for early diagnosis and monitoring of synaptic integrity in prion disease
