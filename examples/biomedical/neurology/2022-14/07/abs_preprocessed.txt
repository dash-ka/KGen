an important challenge in diagnosing antinmda receptor encephalitis is differentiating an important challenge in diagnosing antinmda receptor encephalitis from a first episode of psychosis
psychosis caused by a psychiatric disease
spinal taps are difficult to obtain in psychiatric facilities
csf antibody testing distinguishes an important challenge in diagnosing antinmda receptor encephalitis
a separate problem is the lack of biomarkers of outcome
a separate problem is the lack of biomarkers of antinmda receptor encephalitis severity
here we assessed the performance of neurofilament light chain testing in these settings
in this observational study neurofilament light chain levels were determined with singlemolecule array in patients with pfirst episode of psychosis with the last 2 groups
in this observational study neurofilament light chain levels were determined with singlemolecule array in patients with herpes simplex encephalitis with the last 2 groups
the last 2 groups used as controls
in this observational study neurofilament light chain levels were determined with singlemolecule array in patients with healthy participants with the last 2 groups
in this observational study neurofilament light chain levels were determined with singlemolecule array in patients with antinmda receptor encephalitis with the last 2 groups
receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to obtain clinically useful cutoffs
receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to assess the prediction accuracy of serum neurofilament light chain levels for pfirst episode of psychosis
receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to assess the prediction accuracy of serum neurofilament light chain levels for antinmda receptor encephalitis of psychosis
36 with herpes simplex encephalitis were studied
45 with pfirst episode of psychosis were studied
36 healthy participants were studied
one hundred eighteen patients with antinmda receptor encephalitis were studied
patients with antinmda receptor encephalitis with status epilepticus were more likely to have higher neurofilament light chain than individuals with antinmda receptor encephalitis without these features
patients with antinmda receptor encephalitis without early immunotherapy were more likely to have higher neurofilament light chain than individuals with antinmda receptor encephalitis without these features
patients with antinmda receptor encephalitis with seizures were more likely to have higher neurofilament light chain than individuals with antinmda receptor encephalitis without these features
patients with antinmda receptor encephalitis with csf pleocytosis were more likely to have higher neurofilament light chain than individuals with antinmda receptor encephalitis without these features
patients with antinmda receptor encephalitis with intensive care unit admission were more likely to have higher neurofilament light chain than individuals with antinmda receptor encephalitis without these features
neurofilament light chain levels at diagnosis of antinmda receptor encephalitis did not correlate with outcome at 1year followup assessed with the modified rankin scale
patients with antinmda receptor encephalitis had significantly higher sneurofilament light chain than individuals with lower sneurofilament light chain than patients with herpes simplex encephalitis
patients with antinmda receptor encephalitis had significantly higher sneurofilament light chain than individuals with pfirst episode of healthy participants than patients with herpes simplex encephalitis
patients with antinmda receptor encephalitis had significantly higher sneurofilament light chain than individuals with pfirst episode of psychosis participants than patients with herpes simplex encephalitis
receiver operating characteristics analysis of sneurofilament light chain between antinmda receptor encephalitis with isolated psychosis of psychosis provided an area under an sneurofilament light chain cutoff over 15 pgml to distinguish these disorders
receiver operating characteristics analysis of sneurofilament light chain between antinmda receptor encephalitis with isolated psychosis of psychosis provided an area under the curve of 093 to distinguish these disorders
receiver operating characteristics analysis of sneurofilament light chain between antinmda receptor encephalitis with pfirst episode of psychosis provided an area under the curve of 093 to distinguish these disorders
receiver operating characteristics analysis of sneurofilament light chain between antinmda receptor encephalitis with pfirst episode of psychosis provided an area under an sneurofilament light chain cutoff over 15 pgml to distinguish these disorders
fortythree of 45 patients with first episode of psychosis had serun neurofilament light chain smaller than 15 pgml whereas only 5 of 33 with antinmda receptor encephalitis with isolated psychosis were below this cutoff
none of the patients with herpes simplex encephalitis had sneurofilament light chain smaller than 15 pgml
none of 35 of 36 healthy participants had sneurofilament light chain smaller than 15 pgml
neurofilament light chain associated with longterm outcome
neurofilament light chain associated with features of disease severity
neurofilament light chain measured at diagnosis of antinmda receptor encephalitis
young patients with first episode of sneurofilament light chain over 15 pgml had a 120 times higher chance of having antinmda receptor encephalitis than those with pfirst episode of psychosis
young patients with first episode of psychosis light chain over 15 pgml had a 120 times higher chance of having antinmda receptor encephalitis than those with pfirst episode of psychosis
this cutoff correctly classified 96 percent of patients with first episode of psychosis with antinmda receptor encephalitis with isolated psychosis
this cutoff correctly classified 96 percent of patients with 85 percent of patients with antinmda receptor encephalitis with isolated psychosis
patients with first episode of psychosis of unclear etiology should undergo csf antinmda receptor antibody testing
patients with first episode of sneurofilament light chain over 15 pgml should undergo csf antinmda receptor antibody testing
