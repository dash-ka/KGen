the severity of white matter hyperintensities at presentation with stroke is associated with poststroke dementia and dependency
few data assessing longitudinal interrelationships among changing function after stroke despite the clinical importance
few data assessing longitudinal interrelationships among changing white matter hyperintensities after stroke despite the clinical importance
white matter hyperintensities can decrease after stroke
prediction of cognitive decline is imprecise
however
white matter hyperintensities can increase after stroke
few data assessing longitudinal interrelationships among changing cognition after stroke despite the clinical importance
there are few data
we recruited patients within 3 months of a minor ischemic stroke
expected to result in a modified rankin scale score above 2
a minor ischemic stroke defined as nih stroke scale score smaller than 8
participants repeated mri at modified rankin scale assessments at 3 years
participants repeated mri at cognitive years
participants repeated mri at modified rankin scale assessments at 1 years
participants repeated mri at 1 year years
we ran longitudinal mixedeffects models
models assessing change in addenbrooke cognitive examinationrevised
models assessing change in modified rankin scale scores
volumes adjusting for time to assessment
volumes adjusting for age to assessment
for modified rankin scale score we assessed longitudinal white matter hyperintensities volumes
volumes adjusting for nih stroke scale score to assessment
volumes adjusting for addenbrooke cognitive examinationrevised to assessment
volumes adjusting for stroke subtype to assessment
icv modified vascular risk factors
icv modified premorbid iq
for addenbrooke cognitive examinationrevised score we additionally adjusted for icv
icv modified rankin scale
a multivariate model to jointly assess modified rankin scale score using all available data
a multivariate model to jointly assess changing cognition using all available data
modified rankin scale score adjusted for prognostic variables
changing cognition adjusted for prognostic variables
we then used a multivariate model to jointly assess modified rankin scale score
we then used a multivariate model to jointly assess changing cognition
we recruited 264 patients
one year after stroke normalized white matter hyperintensities volumes were associated more strongly with 1year addenbrooke cognitive examinationrevised score compared to subacute white matter hyperintensities volumes
one year after stroke normalized white matter hyperintensities volumes were associated more strongly with 1year addenbrooke cognitive examinationrevised score compared to addenbrooke cognitive examinationrevised score
threeyear was associated with 3year addenbrooke cognitive examinationrevised score
threeyear modified rankin scale score
combined change in baseline1year jointly assessed modified rankin scale scores was associated with fluctuating white matter hyperintensities volumes
combined change in baseline1year jointly assessed addenbrooke cognitive examinationrevised was associated with fluctuating white matter hyperintensities volumes
after stroke fluctuating white matter hyperintensities mean that baseline white matter hyperintensities volumes are associated strongly with contemporaneous cognitive scores
after stroke fluctuating white matter hyperintensities mean that 1year hyperintensities volumes are associated strongly with contemporaneous cognitive scores
covarying longitudinal decline in cognition after stroke central to dementia diagnosis is associated with increasing white matter hyperintensities volumes
covarying longitudinal decline in independence after stroke central to dementia diagnosis is associated with increasing white matter hyperintensities volumes
