overuse of symptomatic medications is common among those with chronic migraine
overuse of symptomatic medications is associated with developing frequent headaches medication side effects
overuse of symptomatic medications reduced quality of life
patients who have chronic migraine with medication overuse
the optimal treatment strategy for patients has long been debated
the study objective was to determine whether migraine preventive therapy limiting the frequency of the overused medication was noninferior to migraine preventive therapy with switching from the overused medication to an alternative medication
the study objective was to determine whether migraine preventive therapy without switching was noninferior to migraine preventive therapy with switching from the overused medication to an alternative medication
an alternative medication that could be used on over 2 days a week
an alternative used over 2 days a week
an alternative used over continuation of the overused medication with no maximum limit
an openlabel pragmatic clinical trial randomizing adult participants to migraine preventive medication and switching from the overused medication to an alternative
the medication overuse treatment strategy trial was an openlabel pragmatic clinical trial
participants were enrolled between february 2017 and december 2020 from 34 clinics in the united states including headache specialty
participants were enrolled between february 2017 and december 2020 from 34 clinics in the united states including general neurology
participants were enrolled between february 2017 and december 2020 from 34 clinics in the united states including primary care clinics
the primary outcome was moderate to severe headache day frequency during weeks 9 to 12 after randomization
the primary outcome was moderate to severe headache day frequency during weeks 1 to 2 after randomization
seven hundred twenty participants were randomized
at baseline participants averaged 225 headache days over 4 weeks including 128 moderate to severe headache days
at baseline participants averaged 225 headache days over 4 weeks including 214 days of symptomatic medication use
migraine preventive medication without switching of the overused medication was not inferior to preventive medication with switching for moderate to severe headache day frequency during weeks 9 to 12
the treatment strategies also provided similar outcomes during the first 2 weeks
when reduction in moderate to severe headache days was used as the outcome of interest for the management of chronic migraine with medication overuse migraine preventive medication limiting symptomatic medication is not inferior to migraine preventive medication with switching to a different symptomatic medication with a maximum limit of 2 treatment days per week
when reduction in moderate to severe headache days was used as the outcome of interest for the management of chronic migraine with medication overuse migraine preventive medication without switching is not inferior to migraine preventive medication with switching to a different symptomatic medication with a maximum limit of 2 treatment days per week
