Racial and ethnic disparities in stroke outcomes exist, but differences by stroke type are less understood . We studied the association of race and ethnicity with stroke mortality, by stroke type, in a national sample of hospitalized patients in the Veterans Health Administration .

A retrospective observational study was performed including non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic patients with a first hospitalization for stroke between 2002 and 2012 . Stroke was determined using ICD-9 codes and date of death was obtained from the National Death Index . For each of acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, we constructed a piecewise multivariable model for all-cause mortality, using follow-up intervals of less than 30 days, 31 to 90 days, 91 days to 1 year, and above 1 year .

Among 37,790 patients with stroke, 25,492 were non-Hispanic White, 9,752 were non-Hispanic Black, and 2,546 were Hispanic . The cohort was predominantly male . Compared with White patients, Black patients experienced better 30-day survival after acute ischemic stroke and worse 30-day survival after intracerebral hemorrhage . Hispanic patients experienced reduced risk for above 1-year mortality after acute ischemic stroke, but had greater risk of 30-day mortality after subarachnoid hemorrhage compared with White patients .

Among US Veterans, absolute risk of 30-day mortality after intracerebral hemorrhage was 3.2 percent higher for Black patients and after subarachnoid hemorrhage was 10.3 percent higher for Hispanic patients compared with White patients . These findings underscore the importance of investigating stroke outcomes by stroke type to better understand the factors driving observed racial and ethnic disparities .
