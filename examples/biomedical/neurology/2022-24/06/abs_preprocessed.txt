racial disparities in stroke outcomes exist
differences by stroke type are less understood
ethnic disparities in stroke outcomes exist
we studied the association of race with stroke mortality by stroke type in a national sample of hospitalized patients in the veterans health administration
we studied the association of ethnicity with stroke mortality by stroke type in a national sample of hospitalized patients in the veterans health administration
a retrospective observational study was performed including nonhispanic white nonhispanic black
a retrospective observational study was performed including hispanic patients with a first hospitalization for stroke between 2002
a retrospective observational study was performed including hispanic patients with a first hospitalization for stroke between 2012
stroke was determined using icd9 codes
date of death was obtained from the national death index
for each of intracerebral hemorrhage we constructed a piecewise multivariable model for allbecause mortality using followup intervals of less than 30 days 31 to 90 days 91 days to 1 year
for each of acute ischemic stroke we constructed a piecewise multivariable model for allbecause mortality using followup intervals of less than 30 days 31 to 90 days 91 days to 1 year
for each of subarachnoid hemorrhage we constructed a piecewise multivariable model for allbecause mortality using followup intervals of less than 30 days 31 to 90 days 91 days above 1 year

25492 were nonhispanic white 9752 were nonhispanic black
2546 were hispanic
among 37790 patients with stroke
the cohort was predominantly male
compared with white patients black patients experienced better 30day survival after acute ischemic stroke after intracerebral hemorrhage
compared with white patients black patients experienced better 30day survival after worse 30day survival after intracerebral hemorrhage
hispanic patients had greater risk of 30day mortality after subarachnoid hemorrhage compared with white patients
hispanic patients experienced reduced risk for above 1year mortality after acute ischemic stroke
among us veterans absolute risk of 30day mortality after intracerebral hemorrhage was after subarachnoid hemorrhage was 103 percent higher for hispanic patients compared with white patients
among us veterans absolute risk of 30day mortality after intracerebral hemorrhage was 32 percent higher for black patients
the factors driving observed racial disparities
these findings underscore the importance of investigating stroke outcomes by stroke type to better understand the factors
