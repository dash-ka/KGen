To develop and test the performance of the Positive Beta-amyloid Risk Score for prediction of Beta-amyloid positivity in cognitively unimpaired individuals for use in clinical research . Detecting Beta-amyloid positivity is essential for identifying at-risk individuals who are candidates for early intervention with amyloid targeted treatments .

We used data from 4,134 cognitively normal individuals from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer Study . The sample was divided into training and test sets . A modified version of AutoScore, a machine learningâ€“based software tool, was used to develop a scoring system using the training set . Three risk scores were developed using candidate predictors in various combinations from demographics, subjective measures, objective measures, and APOE4 status . Performance of the risk scores was evaluated in the independent test set .

Positive Beta-amyloid Risk Score model 3 showed the highest, but still moderate, performance metrics in comparison with other models with sensitivity of 72.0 percent, specificity of 62.1 percent, accuracy of 65.3 percent, and positive predictive value of 48.1 percent .

Positive Beta-amyloid Risk Score models are a set of simple and practical risk scores that may improve our ability to identify individuals more likely to be amyloid positive . The models can potentially be used to enrich trials and serve as a screening step in research settings . This approach can be followed by the use of additional variables for the development of improved risk scores .
