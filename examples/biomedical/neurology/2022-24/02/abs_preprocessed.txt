to test the performance of the positive betaamyloid risk score for prediction of betaamyloid positivity in cognitively unimpaired individuals for use in clinical research
to develop the performance of the positive betaamyloid risk score for prediction of betaamyloid positivity in cognitively unimpaired individuals for use in clinical research
detecting betaamyloid positivity is essential for identifying atrisk individuals
atrisk individuals who are candidates for early intervention with amyloid
amyloid targeted treatments
we used data from 4134 cognitively normal individuals from the antiamyloid treatment in asymptomatic alzheimer study
the sample was divided into test sets
the sample was divided into training sets
a modified version of autoscore a machine learningbased software tool was used to develop a scoring system
a scoring system using the training set
three risk scores were developed using candidate predictors in various combinations from objective measures
three risk scores were developed using candidate predictors in various combinations from subjective measures
three risk scores were developed using candidate predictors in various combinations from demographics
three risk scores were developed using candidate predictors in various combinations from apoe4 status
performance of the risk scores was evaluated in the independent test set
positive betaamyloid risk score model 3 showed the highest performance metrics in comparison with other models with sensitivity of 720 percent
positive betaamyloid risk score model 3 showed the still moderate performance metrics in comparison with other models with accuracy of 653 percent
positive betaamyloid risk score model 3 showed the still moderate performance metrics in comparison with other models with positive predictive value of 481 percent
positive betaamyloid risk score model 3 showed the highest performance metrics in comparison with other models with specificity of 621 percent

practical risk scores that may improve our ability to identify individuals more likely to be amyloid positive
simple risk scores that may improve our ability to identify individuals more likely to be amyloid positive
positive betaamyloid risk score models are a set of simple risk scores
positive betaamyloid risk score models are a set of practical risk scores
positive betaamyloid risk score models can potentially be used to serve as a screening step in research settings
positive betaamyloid risk score models can potentially be used to enrich trials
this approach can be followed by the use of additional variables for the development of improved risk scores
