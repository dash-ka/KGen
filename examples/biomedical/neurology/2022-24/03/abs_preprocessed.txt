the aims of this work were to compare rates of longitudinal change in neuropsychological test performance between the logopenic progressive aphasia
the aims of this work were to use unbiased principal component analysis to assess heterogeneity in patterns of relationships to concurrent brain atrophy
the aims of this work were to use unbiased principal component analysis to assess heterogeneity in patterns of change to demographics
the aims of this work were to use unbiased principal component analysis to assess heterogeneity in patterns of change to concurrent brain atrophy
the aims of this work were to compare rates of longitudinal change in posterior cortical atrophy variants of atypical alzheimer disease
the aims of this work were to compare rates of longitudinal change in neurologic test performance between the logopenic progressive aphasia
the aims of this work were to use unbiased principal component analysis to assess heterogeneity in patterns of relationships to demographics
patients with posterior cortical atrophy were identified
logopenic progressive aphasia who had undergone structural mri
logopenic progressive aphasia who were positive for amyloid alzheimer disease biomarkers
logopenic progressive aphasia who had undergone serial neuropsychological assessments
logopenic progressive aphasia who had undergone serial neurologic assessments
patients with logopenic progressive aphasia were identified
logopenic progressive aphasia who were positive for tau alzheimer disease biomarkers
rates of change in 13 clinical measures were compared between groups in a casecontrol design
principal component analysis was used to assess patterns of clinical change unbiased by clinical phenotype
components were correlated with rates of regional brain atrophy with tensorbased morphometry
27 patients with logopenic progressive aphasia were identified
twentyeight patients with posterior cortical atrophy were identified
those with logopenic progressive aphasia showed worse baseline performance and faster rates of decline in naming repetition and working memory compared to those with posterior cortical atrophy
those with logopenic progressive aphasia showed faster rates of decline in verbal episodic memory compared to those with posterior cortical atrophy
conversely patients with posterior cortical atrophy showed worse baseline performance on the the clinical dementia rating scale dementia rating scale and faster rates of decline in visuoperceptual function compared to those with logopenic progressive aphasia
conversely patients with posterior cortical atrophy showed worse baseline performance in tests of perceptual function in visuoperceptual function compared to those with logopenic progressive aphasia
conversely patients with posterior cortical atrophy showed worse baseline performance in tests of visuospatial function in visuoperceptual function compared to those with logopenic progressive aphasia
10 principal components required to explain above 90 percent of the variance
principal component analysis showed that patterns of clinical decline were highly heterogeneous across the cohort with 10 principal components
the first principal component reflected overall severity with higher scores in logopenic progressive aphasia than posterior cortical atrophy
higher scores in logopenic progressive aphasia than posterior cortical atrophy reflecting faster decline in logopenic progressive aphasia
the first principal component was related to left temporoparietal atrophy
the second were not related to clinical phenotype
third principal components showed some relationship to regional atrophy
the second showed some relationship to regional atrophy
third principal components were not related to clinical phenotype
no relationships were identified between the principal components and age sex disease duration amyloid pet findings or apolipoprotein genotype
longitudinal patterns of clinical decline are heterogeneous to different patterns of topographic spread
longitudinal patterns of clinical decline are related to different patterns of topographic spread
longitudinal patterns of clinical decline differ between posterior cortical atrophy
longitudinal patterns of clinical decline differ between logopenic progressive aphasia
posterior cortical atrophy is associated with a more slowly progressive course than logopenic progressive aphasia
