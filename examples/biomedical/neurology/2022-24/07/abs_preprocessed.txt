to characterize the association of ambient particulate matter pollution of different sizes with inhospital case fatality among patients with stroke in china
we collected hospitalizations due to stroke in 4 provinces in china from 2013 to 2019
annual averages of particulate matter prior to hospitalization were estimated using bilinear interpolation
sevenday averages of particulate matter prior to hospitalization were estimated using bilinear interpolation
annual averages of particulate matter prior to hospitalization were estimated using residential addresses
sevenday averages of particulate matter prior to hospitalization were estimated using residential addresses
associations with inhospital case fatality were estimated using randomeffects logistic regression models
the number of fatalities were estimated using a counterfactual approach
fatalities attributed to particulate matter
potential reducible fraction were estimated using a counterfactual approach
particulate matter pollution is a risk factor for inhospital strokerelated deaths
strategies may improve the health outcomes of patients with stroke
strategies that target reducing particulate matter pollution
