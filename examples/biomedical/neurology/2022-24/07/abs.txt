To characterize the association of ambient particulate matter pollution of different sizes with in-hospital case fatality among patients with stroke in China .

We collected hospitalizations due to stroke in 4 provinces in China from 2013 to 2019 . Seven-day and annual averages of particulate matter prior to hospitalization were estimated using bilinear interpolation and residential addresses . Associations with in-hospital case fatality were estimated using random-effects logistic regression models . Potential reducible fraction and the number of fatalities attributed to particulate matter were estimated using a counterfactual approach .


particulate matter pollution is a risk factor for in-hospital stroke-related deaths . Strategies that target reducing particulate matter pollution may improve the health outcomes of patients with stroke .
