blood pressure variability is an emerging risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia
mechanisms remain unclear
an emerging risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia examined whether visittovisit blood pressure variability is related to csf alzheimer disease biomarker levels over time
an emerging risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia examined whether associations differed by apoe epsilon4 carrier status
in this retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study cognitively unimpaired older adults from the alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative underwent 3 to 4 blood pressure measurements above 1 lumbar puncture for evaluation of csf
in this retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study mildly impaired older adults from the alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative underwent 3 to 4 blood pressure measurements over a 12month period
csf phosphorylated total tau at followup

csf phosphorylated betaamyloid levels at followup
csf phosphorylated tau at followup
apoe epsilon4 carriers were defined as having at least 1 epsilon4 allele
visittovisit blood pressure variability was determined over 12 months as variability independent of mean
only csf samples were analyzed
only csf samples collected after the final blood pressure measurement
bayesian linear growth modeling investigated the role of the passage of time on csf biomarker levels after controlling for several variables including average blood pressure
bayesian linear growth modeling investigated the role of apoe epsilon4 after controlling for several variables including average blood pressure
bayesian linear growth modeling investigated the role of blood pressure variability after controlling for several variables including baseline hypertension

increased csf phosphorylated tau
elevated blood pressure variability was associated with increased csf
elevated blood pressure variability decreased betaamyloid levels at followup
elevated blood pressure variability increased total tau
apoe epsilon4 carriers with elevated blood pressure variability had the fastest increase in phosphorylated tau levels
blood pressure variability was not significantly related to betaamyloid levels over time according to apoe epsilon4 carrier status
blood pressure variability was not significantly related to total tau over time according to apoe epsilon4 carrier status
older adults with elevated blood pressure variability exhibit increased csf increased total tau and decreased betaamyloid over time suggesting that blood pressure variability may correlate with alterations in alzheimer disease biomarkers
increased csf phosphorylated tau
findings warrant further study of the relationship between blood pressure variability
findings warrant further study of the development of disease
apoe epsilon4 carrier status moderated relationships between csf
csf phosphorylated tau consistent with other studies
csf phosphorylated total tau or betaamyloid consistent with other studies
apoe epsilon4 carrier status moderated relationships between blood pressure variability
other studies relating hemodynamic factors to tau changes
