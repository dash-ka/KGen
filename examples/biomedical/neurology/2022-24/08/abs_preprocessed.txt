eeg is widely used for prediction of neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest
to better understand the relationship between neuronal injury we explored the association of eeg discharges with neurofilament light
to better understand the relationship between eeg injury we explored the association of eeg backgrounds with neurofilament light
to better understand the relationship between neuronal injury we explored the association of eeg backgrounds with neurofilament light
to better understand the relationship between eeg injury we explored the association of eeg discharges with neurofilament light
to better understand the relationship between neuronal injury we explored the association between neurofilament light as a marker of neuroaxonal injury
to better understand the relationship between neuronal injury we explored the association between eeg light as a marker of neuroaxonal injury
to better understand the relationship between eeg injury we explored the association between eeg light as a marker of neuroaxonal injury
to better understand the relationship between eeg injury we explored the association between neurofilament light as a marker of neuroaxonal injury
to better understand the relationship between eeg injury we evaluated whether highly malignant eeg patterns are reflected by high neurofilament light levels
to better understand the relationship between neuronal injury we evaluated whether highly malignant eeg patterns are reflected by high neurofilament light levels
we performed a post hoc analysis of the target temperature management after outofhospital cardiac arrest trial
routine eegs were prospectively performed after the temperature intervention above 36 hours postarrest
patients were excluded
patients who awoke
patients who died prior to 36 hours postarrest
eeg experts blinded to clinical information
clinical information classified highly malignant eeg patterns according to the standardized american clinical neurophysiology society terminology
clinical information classified eeg background according to the standardized american clinical neurophysiology society terminology
clinical information classified amount of discharges according to the standardized american clinical neurophysiology society terminology
prospectively collected serum samples were analyzed for neurofilament light after trial completion
the highest available concentration at 72 hours postarrest was used
the highest available concentration at 48 hours postarrest was used
neurofilament light levels were 13 times higher in patients with malignant patterns than those with benign patterns
patients with highly malignant eeg patterns had 29 times higher neurofilament light levels than patients with malignant patterns
the eeg background were independently strongly associated with neurofilament light levels
the amount of discharges were independently strongly associated with neurofilament light levels
the eeg background had a stronger association with neurofilament light levels than eeg discharges
neurofilament light levels in patients with a continuous background were lower than for any other background
neurofilament light levels did not differ between burst suppression
neurofilament light levels did not differ between suppression suppression
superimposed discharges were only associated with higher neurofilament light levels if the eeg background was continuous
benign eeg patterns reflect the extent of brain injury as measured by neurofilament light in serum
malignant eeg patterns reflect the extent of brain injury as measured by neurofilament light in serum
malignant eeg patterns reflect the extent of brain injury as measured by neurofilament light in serum
the extent of brain injury is more strongly related to the eeg background than superimposed discharges
patients misclassified by single methods
combining neurofilament light may be useful to better identify patients
combining eeg light may be useful to better identify patients
