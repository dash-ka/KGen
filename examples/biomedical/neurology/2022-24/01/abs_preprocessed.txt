we aimed to identify brain metabolism related to mild cognitive impairment in patients with isolated rem sleep behavior disorder
this is a prospective cohort study of patients with isolated rem sleep behavior disorder
at baseline patients with isolated rem sleep behavior disorder underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery
at baseline patients with isolated rem sleep behavior disorder underwent 18ffluorodeoxyglucosepet
at baseline patients with sexmatched healthy controls underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery
at baseline patients with sexmatched healthy controls underwent restingstate fmri scans
at baseline patients with agematched healthy controls underwent 18ffluorodeoxyglucosepet
at baseline patients with sexmatched healthy controls underwent 18ffluorodeoxyglucosepet
at baseline patients with agematched healthy controls underwent restingstate fmri scans
at baseline patients with agematched healthy controls underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery
at baseline patients with isolated rem sleep behavior disorder underwent restingstate fmri scans
voxelwise group comparisons for 18ffluorodeoxyglucosepet data were performed using a general linear model
significant hypometabolism associated with mild cognitive impairment in patients with isolated rem sleep behavior disorder
seedbased connectivity maps were computed using brain regions showing significant hypometabolism
significant hypometabolism associated with mild cognitive impairment compared between groups
a cox regression analysis was applied to investigate the association between brain metabolism and risk of phenoconversion
the isolated rem sleep behavior disordermild cognitive impairment group revealed relative hypometabolism in inferior temporal cortex bilaterally compared with the isolated rem sleep behavior disordernormal cognition group
the isolated rem sleep behavior disordermild cognitive impairment group revealed relative hypometabolism in the inferior parietal lobule bilaterally compared with the isolated rem sleep behavior disordernormal cognition group
the isolated rem sleep behavior disordermild cognitive impairment group revealed relative hypometabolism in lateral occipital bilaterally compared with healthy control disordernormal cognition group
the isolated rem sleep behavior disordermild cognitive impairment group revealed relative hypometabolism in medial occipital bilaterally compared with the isolated rem sleep behavior disordernormal cognition group
the isolated rem sleep behavior disordermild cognitive impairment group revealed relative hypometabolism in lateral occipital bilaterally compared with the isolated rem sleep behavior disordernormal cognition group
the isolated rem sleep behavior disordermild cognitive impairment group revealed relative hypometabolism in middle temporal cortex bilaterally compared with the isolated rem sleep behavior disordernormal cognition group

the isolated rem sleep behavior disordermild cognitive impairment group revealed relative hypometabolism in medial occipital bilaterally compared with healthy control disordernormal cognition group
in seedbased connectivity analyses disordermild cognitive impairment group exhibited decreased functional connectivity of the left angular gyrus with the occipital cortex
in the isolated rem sleep behavior disordermild cognitive impairment group exhibited decreased functional connectivity of the left angular gyrus with the occipital cortex
of 40 patients with isolated rem sleep behavior disorder 12 patients converted to parkinson disease or dementia with lewy bodies
hypometabolism of medial occipital was associated with higher phenoconversion rate to parkinson disease or dementia with lewy bodies lewy
hypometabolism of precuneus was associated with higher phenoconversion rate to parkinson disease or dementia with lewy bodies lewy
hypometabolism of the occipital pole was associated with higher phenoconversion rate to parkinson disease or dementia with lewy bodies lewy
mild cognitive impairment in isolated rem sleep behavior disorder is related to functional changes in broad brain areas particularly the occipital areas
mild cognitive impairment in isolated rem sleep behavior disorder is related to functional changes in broad brain areas particularly the parietal areas
mild cognitive impairment in isolated rem sleep behavior disorder is related to metabolic changes in broad brain areas particularly the parietal areas
mild cognitive impairment in isolated rem sleep behavior disorder is related to metabolic changes in broad brain areas particularly the occipital areas
moreover hypometabolism in these brain regions was a predictor of phenoconversion to parkinson disease or dementia with lewy bodies lewy
evaluation of cognitive function could be useful for risk stratification in patients with isolated rem sleep behavior disorder
evaluation of neuroimaging characteristics could be useful for risk stratification in patients with isolated rem sleep behavior disorder
