cerebrovascular disease is frequently comorbid with autopsyconfirmed alzheimer disease
its contribution to the clinical presentation of alzheimer disease contribution to the clinical presentation of comorbid cerebrovascular disease remains unclear
its contribution to the clinical presentation of alzheimer disease leveraged the national alzheimer coordinating center uniform to compare the functional trajectories of cerebrovascular disease brain donors

its contribution to the clinical presentation of alzheimer disease included complete uniform data set evaluations between 2005 with the most recent uniform data set evaluation within 2 years of autopsy
its contribution to the clinical presentation of alzheimer disease included complete uniform data set evaluations between 2019 with the most recent uniform data set evaluation within 2 years of autopsy
its contribution to the clinical presentation of alzheimer disease included national alzheimer coordinating center brain donors with autopsyconfirmed alzheimer disease with the most recent uniform data set evaluation within 2 years of autopsy
cerebrovascular disease was defined as moderate to severe arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis
its contribution to the clinical presentation of alzheimer disease used propensity score weighting to isolate the effects of the alzheimer disease with cerebrovascular disease group
its contribution to the clinical presentation of alzheimer disease used propensity score weighting to isolate the effects of the alzheimer disease with cerebrovascular disease
this method improved the balance of covariates between the alzheimer disease with cerebrovascular disease group with cerebrovascular disease group without cerebrovascular disease group

longitudinal mixedeffects models were assessed with robust bayesian estimation
uniform data set neuropsychological test were primary outcomes
the clinical dementia rating scale sum of boxes scores were primary outcomes
the alzheimer disease with cerebrovascular disease group had accelerated decline on measures of processing speed

the alzheimer disease with cerebrovascular disease group had accelerated decline on measures of working memory verbal fluency
effects ranged from weak to strong
we also found worse performance in the alzheimer disease with cerebrovascular disease group with cerebrovascular disease group across verbal fluency and more impaired clinical dementia rating scale sum of boxes scores
we also found worse performance in the alzheimer disease with cerebrovascular disease group with cerebrovascular disease group across time on naming
in brain donors with autopsyconfirmed alzheimer disease comorbid cerebrovascular disease was associated with an accelerated cognitive decline particularly on working memory
in brain donors with autopsyconfirmed alzheimer disease comorbid cerebrovascular disease was associated with an accelerated functional decline particularly on working memory
in brain donors with autopsyconfirmed alzheimer disease comorbid cerebrovascular disease was associated with an accelerated cognitive decline particularly on psychomotor speed
in brain donors with autopsyconfirmed alzheimer disease comorbid cerebrovascular disease was associated with an accelerated functional decline particularly on psychomotor speed
in brain donors with autopsyconfirmed alzheimer disease comorbid cerebrovascular disease was associated with an accelerated functional decline particularly on neuropsychological tests of attention

cerebrovascular disease magnified effects of alzheimer disease neuropathology on semanticrelated neuropsychological tasks
findings support a prominent additive synergistic effect for comorbid cerebrovascular disease neuropathology in comorbid cerebrovascular disease
findings support a more subtle synergistic effect for comorbid cerebrovascular disease neuropathology in comorbid cerebrovascular disease
