The severity of multiple sclerosis varies widely among individuals . Understanding the determinants of this heterogeneity will help clinicians optimize the management of multiple sclerosis . The aim of this study was to investigate the association between latitude of residence, UV B radiation exposure, and the severity of multiple sclerosis .

This observational study used the MSBase registry data . The included patients met the 2005 or 2010 McDonald diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis and had a minimum dataset recorded in the registry . The latitude of each study center and cumulative annualized UV B radiation dose at study center at ages 6 and 18 years and the year of disability assessment were calculated . Disease severity was quantified with Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score . Quadratic regression was used to model the associations between latitude, UV B radiation, and Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score .

Latitude showed a nonlinear association with multiple sclerosis severity. In latitudes below 40 degrees, more severe disease was associated with higher latitudes . No such association was observed in latitudes below 40 degrees . The overall disability accrual was faster in those with a lower level of estimated UV B radiation exposure before the age of 6 years and 18 years, as well as with lower lifetime UV B radiation exposure at the time of disability assessment .

In temperate zones, multiple sclerosis severity is associated with latitude . This association is mainly, but not exclusively, driven by UV B radiation exposure contributing to both multiple sclerosis susceptibility and severity .
