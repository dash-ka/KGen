the severity of multiple sclerosis varies widely among individuals
understanding the determinants of this heterogeneity will help clinicians optimize the management of multiple sclerosis
the aim of this observational study was to investigate the association between latitude of residence
the aim of this observational study was to investigate the association between latitude of uv b radiation exposure
the aim of this observational study was to investigate the association between latitude of the severity of multiple sclerosis
this observational study used the msbase registry data
the met the 2005 for multiple sclerosis
the included patients
a minimum dataset recorded in the registry
the met 2010 mcdonald diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis
the had a minimum dataset
the latitude of each study center were calculated
the latitude of cumulative annualized uv b radiation dose at study center at ages 6 years were calculated
the latitude of cumulative annualized uv b radiation dose at study center at the year of disability assessment were calculated
the latitude of cumulative annualized uv b radiation dose at study center at ages 18 years were calculated
disease severity was quantified with multiple sclerosis severity score
quadratic regression was used to model the associations between latitude
quadratic regression was used to model the associations between uv b radiation
quadratic regression was used to model the associations between multiple sclerosis severity score
latitude showed a nonlinear association with multiple sclerosis severity
in latitudes below 40 degrees more severe disease was associated with higher latitudes
no such association was observed in latitudes below 40 degrees
the overall disability accrual was faster in those with a lower level of estimated uv b radiation exposure before the age of 6 years radiation exposure at the time of disability assessment
the overall disability accrual was faster in those with a lower level of estimated uv b radiation exposure before the age of 18 years radiation exposure at the time of disability assessment
the overall disability accrual was faster in those with a lower level of estimated uv b radiation exposure with lower lifetime uv b radiation exposure at the time of disability assessment
in temperate zones multiple sclerosis severity is associated with latitude
a nonlinear association is not exclusively driven by uv b radiation exposure
uv b radiation exposure contributing to severity
uv b radiation exposure contributing to both multiple sclerosis susceptibility
a nonlinear association is mainly driven by uv b radiation exposure
