a more comprehensive holistic approach may provide deeper insights into the biology of collateral perfusion on medical imaging
collateral status assessment mostly relies on single imaging biomarkers
comprehensive collateralization is defined as blood flow of cerebral arteries through the brain tissue

comprehensive assessment of the collateral blood flow cascade in patients with acute stroke is a strong predictor of radiologic outcomes in patientscontemporary cardiovascular disease risk prediction models are rarely applied in routine clinical practice in china due to substantial regional differences in absolute risks of major contemporary cardiovascular disease types within china
moreover the inclusion of blood lipids in most risk prediction models also limits the inclusion of blood lipids in most risk prediction models use in the chinese population
