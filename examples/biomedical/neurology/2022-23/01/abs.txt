Contemporary cardiovascular disease risk prediction models are rarely applied in routine clinical practice in China due to substantial regional differences in absolute risks of major Contemporary cardiovascular disease types within China . Moreover, the inclusion of blood lipids in most risk prediction models also limits their use in the Chinese population . We developed 10-year Contemporary cardiovascular disease risk prediction models excluding blood lipids that may be applicable to diverse regions of China .

We derived sex-specific models separately for ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke in addition to total Contemporary cardiovascular disease in the China Kadoorie Biobank . Participants were age 30 to 79 years without Contemporary cardiovascular disease at baseline . Predictors included age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, use of blood pressureâ€“lowering treatment, current daily smoking, diabetes, and waist circumference . Total Contemporary cardiovascular disease risks were combined in terms of conditional probability using the predicted risks of 3 submodels . Risk models were recalibrated in each region by 2 methods and risk prediction was estimated before and after recalibration .

The calibration performances improved after recalibration, with models after ideal recalibration showing the best model performances . The results for men were comparable to those for women .

Our Contemporary cardiovascular disease risk prediction models yielded good discrimination of ischemic heart disease and stroke subtypes in addition to total Contemporary cardiovascular disease without including blood lipids . Flexible recalibration of our models for different regions could enable more widespread use using resident health records covering the overall Chinese population .
