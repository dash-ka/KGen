contemporary cardiovascular disease risk prediction models are rarely applied in routine clinical practice in china due to substantial regional differences in absolute risks of major contemporary cardiovascular disease types within china
moreover the inclusion of blood lipids in most risk prediction models also limits the inclusion of blood lipids in most risk prediction models use in the chinese population
blood lipids that may be applicable to diverse regions of china
we developed 10year contemporary cardiovascular disease risk prediction models excluding blood lipids
we derived sexspecific models separately for hemorrhagic stroke in addition to total contemporary cardiovascular disease in the china kadoorie biobank
we derived sexspecific models separately for ischemic heart disease to total contemporary cardiovascular disease in the china kadoorie biobank
we derived sexspecific models separately for ischemic stroke to total contemporary cardiovascular disease in the china kadoorie biobank
participants were age 30 to 79 years without contemporary cardiovascular disease at baseline
predictors included waist circumference
predictors included diabetes
predictors included current daily smoking
predictors included systolic blood pressure
predictors included diastolic blood pressure
predictors included use of blood pressurelowering treatment
predictors included age
total contemporary cardiovascular disease risks were combined in terms of conditional probability using the predicted risks of 3 submodels
risk models were recalibrated in each region by 2 methods
risk models were risk prediction was estimated before and after recalibration
the calibration performances improved after recalibration with models after ideal recalibration
models after ideal recalibration showing the best model performances
the results for men were comparable to those for women
our contemporary cardiovascular disease risk prediction models yielded good discrimination of stroke subtypes in addition to total contemporary cardiovascular disease without including blood lipids
our contemporary cardiovascular disease risk prediction models yielded good discrimination of ischemic heart disease in addition to total contemporary cardiovascular disease without including blood lipids
flexible recalibration of our models for different regions could enable more widespread use using resident health records covering the overall chinese population
