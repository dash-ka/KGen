recent studies fueled doubts as to whether all currently defined central disorders of hypersomnolence are idiopathic hypersomnia
recent studies fueled doubts as to whether all currently defined central disorders of hypersomnolence are stable entities
recent studies fueled doubts as to whether all currently defined central disorders of hypersomnolence are especially narcolepsy type 2
the question arises of whether current diagnostic criteria of hypersomnolence disorders should be reassessed
new reliable biomarkers are needed
the main aim of this datadriven observational study was to see whether datadriven algorithms would segregate narcolepsy type 1
the main aim of this datadriven observational study was to see whether datadriven algorithms would identify more reliable subgrouping of individuals without cataplexy with new clinical biomarkers
we used an unsupervised machine to identify distinct hypersomnolence clusters in the largescale european narcolepsy network database
an unsupervised machine learning algorithm
we used agglomerative hierarchical clustering to identify distinct hypersomnolence clusters in the largescale european narcolepsy network database
97 variables covering all aspects of central hypersomnolence disorders such as laboratory biomarkers
we included 97 variables
97 variables covering all aspects of central hypersomnolence disorders such as objective sleep measures
97 variables covering all aspects of central hypersomnolence disorders such as symptoms sleep measures
97 variables covering all aspects of central hypersomnolence disorders such as demographics sleep measures
97 variables covering all aspects of central hypersomnolence disorders such as subjective sleep measures
we specifically focused on subgrouping of patients without cataplexy
the minimal number for which patients without cataplexy were put in distinct groups
the number of clusters was chosen to be the minimal number
these 2 clusters were identified of which 4 clusters included predominantly individuals with cataplexy
among other variables significantly differed in presence of sleep drunkenness subjective difficulty awakening
the 2 most distinct clusters consisted of 158 patients were dominated by those without cataplexy
the 2 most distinct clusters consisted of 157 patients were dominated by those without cataplexy
among other variables significantly differed in presence of weekendweek sleep length difference
idiopathic hypersomnia were evenly mixed in these 2 clusters
patients formally diagnosed as having narcolepsy type 2
using a datadriven approach in the largest study on central disorders of hypersomnolence to date this datadriven observational study identified distinct patient subgroups within the central disorders of hypersomnolence population
our results provide promising new variables for reliable diagnostic categories
reliable diagnostic categories that better resemble different patient phenotypes
our results contest inclusion of sleeponset rem periods in diagnostic criteria for people without cataplexy
a more solid hypersomnolence classification system that is less vulnerable to instability of single features
clusterguided classification will result in a more solid hypersomnolence classification system
