the best treatment options for patients with strokelike episodes remain uncertain
stroke management in the context of primary mitochondrial disease is clinically challenging
we sought to perform a systematic review of the safety and efficacy of larginine use in the acute management of strokelike episodes in patients with mitochondrial disease
we sought to perform a systematic review of the safety and efficacy of larginine use in the prophylactic management of strokelike episodes in patients with mitochondrial disease
a systematic review of the safety and efficacy of larginine use was registered in prospero

improved headache at 24 hours was the greatest reported benefit in response to iv larginine in the openlabel trials
48 patients who positively responded to prophylactic larginine
in 15 of 48 patients antiepileptic drugs were either used
in 15 of 48 patients antiepileptic drugs were unreported
moderate adverse events were reported in the followup of both oral larginine treatment
11 patients died during followup
moderate adverse events were reported in the followup of both iv
11 patients died while on prophylactic treatment
the available evidence is classified as level 5
the available evidence is of poor methodologic quality
iv confers no demonstrable clinical benefit in either the acute treatment of lactic acidosis with more robust controlled trials
iv confers no demonstrable clinical benefit in either the acute treatment of mitochondrial encephalopathy with more robust controlled trials
iv confers no demonstrable clinical benefit in either the acute treatment of strokelike episodes with more robust controlled trials
oral larginine confers no demonstrable clinical benefit in either the acute treatment of strokelike episodes with more robust controlled trials
more robust controlled trials required to assess safety profile
more robust controlled trials required to assess iv efficacy
