the goal of this work was to determine whether increases motor function in adults with charcotmarietooth disease type 1
the goal of this work was to determine whether increases quality of life in adults with charcotmarietooth disease type 1
the goal of this work was to determine whether locally acting ace083 is safe
the goal of this work was to determine whether tolerated
the goal of this work was to determine whether increases muscle volume in adults with charcotmarietooth disease type 1
this phase 2 study enrolled adults with charcotmarietooth disease type charcotmarietooth disease type x
this phase 2 study enrolled adults with charcotmarietooth disease type 1
part 1 was open label
part 1 evaluated the safety and tolerability of different dose levels of ace083 for use in part 2
part 2 was a randomized placebocontrolled 6month study of 240 mg per muscle ace083 injected bilaterally into the tibialis anterior muscle followed by a 6month openlabel extension
a 6month openlabel extension in which all patients received ace083
pharmacodynamic endpoints included fat fraction
pharmacodynamic endpoints included total muscle volume
pharmacodynamic endpoints included contractile muscle volume
additional secondary endpoints included muscle strength
additional secondary endpoints included 10m walk and run
additional secondary endpoints included 6minute walk test
additional secondary endpoints included quality of life
safety was assessed with clinical laboratory tests
safety was assessed with treatmentemergent adverse events
in part 1 ace083 was generally safe and well tolerated at all dose levels with treatmentemergent adverse events of grade 3
in part 1 ace083 was generally safe and well tolerated at all dose levels with death reported
in part 1 ace083 was generally safe and well tolerated at all dose levels with treatmentemergent adverse events of grade greater
in part 1 ace083 was generally safe and well tolerated at all dose levels with no serious adverse events
in part 2 there was significantly greater change in total muscle volume with ace083 compared with placebo
there was change in ankle dorsiflexion strength
there was significant difference between ace083 for contractile muscle volume
there was significant difference between placebo for contractile muscle volume
all other functional outcomes were not significantly improved by ace083
fat fraction were not significantly improved by ace083
moderate to mild injectionsite reactions were the most common treatmentemergent adverse events
those receiving placebo
despite significantly increased total muscle contractile muscle volume patients with charcotmarietooth disease did not demonstrate greater functional improvement compared with those
