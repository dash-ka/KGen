The goal of this work was to determine whether locally acting ACE-083 is safe and well tolerated and increases muscle volume, motor function, and quality of life in adults with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 .

This phase 2 study enrolled adults with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type X . Part 1 was open label and evaluated the safety and tolerability of different dose levels of ACE-083 for use in part 2 . Part 2 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month study of 240 mg per muscle ACE-083 injected bilaterally into the tibialis anterior muscle, followed by a 6-month, open-label extension in which all patients received ACE-083 . Pharmacodynamic endpoints included total muscle volume, contractile muscle volume, and fat fraction . Additional secondary endpoints included 6-minute walk test, 10-m walk and run, muscle strength, and quality of life . Safety was assessed with treatment-emergent adverse events and clinical laboratory tests .

In part 1, ACE-083 was generally safe and well tolerated at all dose levels, with no serious adverse events, treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or greater, or death reported . In part 2, there was significantly greater change in Total muscle volume with ACE-083 compared with placebo . There was significant difference between ACE-083 and placebo for contractile muscle volume and change in ankle dorsiflexion strength . Fat fraction and all other functional outcomes were not significantly improved by ACE-083 . Moderate to mild injection-site reactions were the most common treatment-emergent adverse events .

Despite significantly increased Total muscle volume and contractile muscle volume, patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease receiving ACE-083 in tibialis anterior muscles did not demonstrate greater functional improvement compared with those receiving placebo .
