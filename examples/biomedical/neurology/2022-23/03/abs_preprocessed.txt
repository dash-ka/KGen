to evaluate whether children born to women have higher risk of neonatal seizures and epilepsy
women who use serotonergic antidepressants during pregnancy
we used swedish registerbased data to examine associations between maternal reported use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in diagnosis of neonatal seizures
we used swedish registerbased data to examine associations between maternal reported use of serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors in diagnosis of neonatal seizures
we used swedish registerbased data to examine associations between maternal reported use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in pregnancy of neonatal seizures
we used swedish registerbased data to examine associations between epilepsy in over 12 million children
we used swedish registerbased data to examine associations between maternal reported use of serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors in pregnancy of neonatal seizures
to account for systematic differences between exposed children we adjusted for a wide range of measured confounders
to account for systematic differences between unexposed children we adjusted for a wide range of measured confounders
first evaluating the role of serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor use
first evaluating the role of parental epilepsy
first evaluating the role of maternal indication for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
after first we adjusted for remaining parental background factors
after first we adjusted for pregnancyspecific characteristics
women who reported serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor in pregnancy
women who reported use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
compared with all other children children of women had an elevated risk of neonatal seizures and epilepsy
the estimates of association were attenuated by adjustment for maternal indications for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
the estimates of association were attenuated by adjustment for maternal indications for serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor use
the estimates of association were attenuated by adjustment for maternal indications by additional adjustment for parental history of epilepsy
full adjustment for all resulted in substantial attenuation of the remaining associations
all measured pregnancyspecific factors
all measured parental factors
we found no support for the concern that maternal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors increases children risk for neonatal seizures or epilepsy
we found no support for the concern that serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor use in pregnancy increases children risk for neonatal seizures or epilepsy
