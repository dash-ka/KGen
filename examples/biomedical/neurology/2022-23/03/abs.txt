To evaluate whether children born to women who use serotonergic antidepressants during pregnancy have higher risk of neonatal seizures and epilepsy .

We used Swedish register-based data to examine associations between maternal reported use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors in pregnancy and diagnosis of neonatal seizures or epilepsy in over 1.2 million children . To account for systematic differences between exposed and unexposed children, we adjusted for a wide range of measured confounders . After first evaluating the role of maternal indication for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor use and parental epilepsy, we adjusted for remaining parental background factors and pregnancy-specific characteristics .

Compared with all other children, children of women who reported use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor in pregnancy had an elevated risk of neonatal seizures and epilepsy . The estimates of association were attenuated by adjustment for maternal indications for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor use , but not by additional adjustment for parental history of epilepsy . Full adjustment for all measured parental and pregnancy-specific factors resulted in substantial attenuation of the remaining associations .

We found no support for the concern that maternal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor use in pregnancy increases children risk for neonatal seizures or epilepsy .
