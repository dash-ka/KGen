traumatic brain injury is considered a potential modifiable dementia risk factor
we aimed to determine whether traumatic brain injury actually increases the risk of dementia when adjusting for other relevant dementia risk factors
a national prospective longitudinal cohort study that included representative population samples from different parts of finland of patients 25 through 64 years of age from 1992 to 2012
this was a national prospective longitudinal cohort study
a national prospective longitudinal cohort study that included random population samples from different parts of finland of patients 25 through 64 years of age from 1992 to 2012
hospital length of stay above minor traumatic brain injury was defined as a diagnosis of hospital length of stay below 1 day
major traumatic brain injury was defined as a diagnosis of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage
hospital length of stay above minor traumatic brain injury was defined as a diagnosis of concussion length of stay below 1 day
hospital length of stay above 3 days was defined as a diagnosis of concussion length of stay below 1 day
hospital length of stay above 3 days was defined as a diagnosis of hospital length of stay below 1 day
dementia was defined as any first hospital contact with dementia as an underlying or contributing because of death
dementia was defined as any first hospital contact with a diagnosis of dementia
dementia was defined as any first hospital contact with first use of an antidementia drug
followup was until end of 2017
followup was until death of 2017
after adjusting for age minor traumatic brain injury increased the risk of dementia
after adjusting for sex minor traumatic brain injury increased the risk of dementia
after adjusting for age hospitalization due to major traumatic brain injury increased the risk of dementia
after adjusting for sex hospitalization due to major traumatic brain injury increased the risk of dementia
after additional adjustment for smoking status the association between dementia weakened
after additional adjustment for physical activity the association between dementia weakened
after additional adjustment for smoking status the association between major traumatic brain injury weakened
after additional adjustment for hypertension the association between dementia weakened
after additional adjustment for educational status the association between major traumatic brain injury weakened
after additional adjustment for hypertension the association between major traumatic brain injury weakened
after additional adjustment for educational status the association between dementia weakened
after additional adjustment for alcohol consumption the association between major traumatic brain injury weakened
after additional adjustment for physical activity the association between major traumatic brain injury weakened
after additional adjustment for alcohol consumption the association between dementia weakened
the risk factors most strongly attenuating the association between dementia were alcohol consumption
the risk factors most strongly attenuating the association between major traumatic brain injury were alcohol consumption
the risk factors most strongly attenuating the association between dementia were physical activity
the risk factors most strongly attenuating the association between major traumatic brain injury were physical activity
there was an association between hospitalized incident dementia
there was an association between hospitalized major traumatic brain injury
an association was diluted after adjusting for confounders
an association was diluted after adjusting for especially alcohol consumption
an association was diluted after adjusting for physical activity
hospitalization due to minor traumatic brain injury was not associated with an increased risk of dementia
