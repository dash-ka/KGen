Traumatic brain injury is considered a potential modifiable dementia risk factor . We aimed to determine whether Traumatic brain injury actually increases the risk of dementia when adjusting for other relevant dementia risk factors .

This was a national prospective longitudinal cohort study that included random and representative population samples from different parts of Finland of patients 25 through 64 years of age from 1992 to 2012 . Major Traumatic brain injury was defined as a diagnosis of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and hospital length of stay above 3 days and minor Traumatic brain injury  was defined as a diagnosis of concussion and hospital length of stay below 1 day . Dementia was defined as any first hospital contact with a diagnosis of dementia, first use of an antidementia drug, or dementia as an underlying or contributing cause of death . Follow-up was until death or end of 2017 .

After adjusting for age and sex, hospitalization due to major Traumatic brain injury, but not minor Traumatic brain injury, increased the risk of dementia . After additional adjustment for educational status, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and hypertension, the association between major Traumatic brain injury and dementia weakened . The risk factors most strongly attenuating the association between major Traumatic brain injury and dementia were alcohol consumption and physical activity .

There was an association between hospitalized major Traumatic brain injury and incident dementia . The association was diluted after adjusting for confounders, especially alcohol consumption and physical activity . Hospitalization due to minor Traumatic brain injury was not associated with an increased risk of dementia .
