Naming decline after left temporal lobe epilepsy surgery is common and difficult to predict . Preoperative language fMRI may predict naming decline, but this application is still lacking evidence . We performed a large multicenter cohort study of the effectiveness of fMRI in predicting naming deficits after left temporal lobe epilepsy surgery .

At 10 US epilepsy centers, 81 patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy were prospectively recruited and given the Boston Naming Test before and 7 months after anterior temporal lobectomy . An fMRI language laterality index was measured with an auditory semantic decisionâ€“tone decision task contrast . Correlations and a multiple regression model were built with a priori chosen predictors .

Preoperative Boston Naming Test score and duration of epilepsy were not correlated with naming decline .

An fMRI-based regression model predicted naming outcome after left temporal lobe epilepsy surgery in a large, prospective multicenter sample, with fMRI as the strongest predictor . These results provide evidence supporting the use of preoperative language fMRI to predict language outcome in patients undergoing left temporal lobe epilepsy surgery .
