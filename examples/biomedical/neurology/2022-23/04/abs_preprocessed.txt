naming decline after left temporal lobe epilepsy surgery is common and difficult to predict
preoperative language fmri may predict naming decline
this application is still lacking evidence
we performed a large multicenter cohort study of the effectiveness of fmri in predicting naming deficits after left temporal lobe epilepsy surgery
at 10 us epilepsy centers 81 patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy were prospectively given the boston naming test before and 7 months after anterior temporal lobectomy
at 10 us epilepsy centers 81 patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy were prospectively recruited the boston naming test before and 7 months after anterior temporal lobectomy
an fmri language laterality index was measured with an auditory semantic decisiontone decision task contrast
correlations were built with a priori
a priori chosen predictors
a multiple regression model were built with a priori
preoperative boston were not correlated with naming decline
preoperative boston naming test score and duration of epilepsy
an fmribased regression model predicted naming outcome after left temporal lobe epilepsy surgery in a large prospective multicenter sample with fmri as the strongest predictor
patients undergoing left temporal lobe epilepsy surgery
these results provide evidence
evidence supporting the use of preoperative language fmri to predict language outcome in patients
