adolescents with chronic migraine may have high levels of headacherelated disability
adolescents with chronic migraine have largely been excluded from clinical trials
children with chronic migraine may have high levels of headacherelated disability
children with chronic migraine have largely been excluded from clinical trials
chronic migraine who have continuous headache
understanding patientvalued treatment outcomes may facilitate future study design
the aim of this work was to identify patientvalued outcome measures for headache preventive treatments among adolescents with continuous headache due to chronic migraine and adolescents with continuous headache parents
chronic migraine who had continuous headache
chronic migraine who had who were being cared for at a tertiary pediatric headache clinic and a tertiary pediatric headache clinic and their parents parents
adolescents with an international classification of headache disorders 3rd edition diagnosis of chronic migraine were surveyed to query the value of treatment outcomes in associated symptoms
adolescents with an international classification of headache disorders 3rd edition diagnosis of chronic migraine were surveyed to query the value of treatment outcomes in functional impact
adolescents with an international classification of headache disorders 3rd edition diagnosis of chronic migraine were surveyed to query the value of treatment outcomes in intensity
adolescents with an international classification of headache disorders 3rd edition diagnosis of chronic migraine were surveyed to query the value of treatment outcomes in the domains of headache frequency
individual outcomes and categories of outcomes were ranked in order of preference using weighted average rank
results were rounded to the degree of precision with which results were measured
the most valued individual outcome measure among both adolescents and parents
overall the most was a decrease in frequency of more severe headaches
outcomes reflecting headache intensity
however outcomes were most valued by adolescents while outcomes were most valued by parents
outcomes reflecting functional impact
among associated symptoms improvement in brain fog was most highly valued by both parents
among associated symptoms improvement in brain fog was most highly valued by both adolescents
the results of this study provide important information
important information about which preventive treatment outcomes are valued by adolescents with continuous headache due to chronic migraine
important information about which preventive treatment outcomes are valued by adolescents with continuous headache due to both adolescents
important information about which preventive treatment outcomes are valued by adolescents with continuous headache due to both parents parents
results suggest that adolescents value a decrease in frequency of severe headaches over a decrease in frequency of headache days overall
generalizability had headache disorders
generalizability may be limited because the surveyed population was being cared for at a tertiary pediatric headache clinic
headache disorders that were refractory to treatment
the results of this study may help guide future trial design in this population with continuous headache due to chronic migraine
