Corticosteroids are the first-line immunosuppressants in the management of juvenile myasthenia gravis despite their adverse effects . The place of new immunosuppressive therapies is not clearly defined by the last international consensus held in March 2019 due to the lack of clinical trials . The aim of this study is to describe the use of rituximab and its efficacy and safety in 8 main pediatric centers of the French neuromuscular reference network to propose a new place in the therapeutic strategy of juvenile myasthenia gravis .

We conducted a retrospective multicenter study from January 1, 2009, to April 30, 2020, including a large cohort of children with myasthenia gravis in 8 main French pediatric reference centers of the FILNEMUS network . The type of myasthenia, different lines of immunosuppressive treatment, and clinical course of the patients were collected . To evaluate the efficacy of rituximab, we studied the clinical course of patients on immunosuppressive therapy . Outcome was defined as the clinical and therapeutic status of patients at the last visit, either stable without immunosuppressants, stable with immunosuppressants, or unstable .

Patients treated with rituximab had a better outcome than patients treated with conventional immunosuppressants . The use of rituximab as a first-line immunosuppressant showed a better efficacy with a discontinuation of immunosuppressants in 75 percent of patients and results in cortisone sparing compared with rituximab treatment as a second-line or third-line immunosuppression . Rituximab was well tolerated .

The use of rituximab has increased in France over the last 10 years as a first-line immunosuppressant . This study suggests good tolerability and efficacy of rituximab in juvenile myasthenia gravis . Early use appears to improve outcomes and facilitate cortisone sparing in antibody-positive generalized juvenile myasthenia .
