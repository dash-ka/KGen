corticosteroids are the firstline immunosuppressants in the management of juvenile myasthenia gravis despite corticosteroids adverse effects
the last international consensus held in march 2019 due to the lack of clinical trials
the place of new immunosuppressive therapies is not clearly defined by the last international consensus
the aim of this study is to describe this study efficacy and safety in 8 main pediatric centers of the french neuromuscular reference network to propose a new place in the therapeutic strategy of juvenile myasthenia gravis
the aim of this study is to describe the use of rituximab to propose a new place in the therapeutic strategy of juvenile myasthenia gravis
we conducted a retrospective multicenter study from january 1 2009 to
a large cohort of children with myasthenia gravis in 8 main french pediatric reference centers of the french neuromuscular reference network
april 30 2020
we conducted a retrospective multicenter study from january 1 2009 to april 30 2020
the type of myasthenia were collected
clinical course of the patients were collected
different lines of immunosuppressive treatment were collected
to evaluate the efficacy of rituximab we studied the clinical course of patients on immunosuppressive therapy
outcome was unstable
outcome was defined as the clinical status of patients at the last visit
outcome was defined stable without immunosuppressants stable with immunosuppressants
outcome was defined as the therapeutic status of patients at the last visit
patients treated with conventional immunosuppressants
patients had a better outcome than patients
patients treated with rituximab
the use of rituximab as a firstline immunosuppressant showed a better efficacy with a discontinuation of immunosuppressants in 75 percent of results in cortisone sparing compared with rituximab treatment as a secondline
the use of rituximab as a firstline immunosuppressant showed a better efficacy with a discontinuation of immunosuppressants in 75 percent of patients in cortisone sparing compared with rituximab treatment as thirdline immunosuppression
the use of rituximab as a firstline immunosuppressant showed a better efficacy with a discontinuation of immunosuppressants in 75 percent of patients in cortisone sparing compared with rituximab treatment as a secondline
the use of rituximab as a firstline immunosuppressant showed a better efficacy with a discontinuation of immunosuppressants in 75 percent of results in cortisone sparing compared with rituximab treatment as thirdline immunosuppression
rituximab was well tolerated
the use of rituximab as a firstline immunosuppressant has increased in france over the last 10 years as a firstline immunosuppressant
this study suggests good tolerability and efficacy of rituximab in juvenile myasthenia gravis
early use appears to facilitate cortisone sparing in antibodypositive
antibodypositive generalized juvenile myasthenia
early use appears to improve outcomes
