robust cerebral collaterals are associated with favorable outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion
large vessel occlusion treated by thrombectomy
however
a more comprehensive holistic approach may provide deeper insights into the biology of collateral perfusion on medical imaging
collateral status assessment mostly relies on single imaging biomarkers
comprehensive collateralization is defined as blood flow of cerebral arteries through the brain tissue
comprehensive collateralization is defined as blood flow of cerebral arteries into draining veins
we hypothesized that a comprehensive analysis of the cerebral collateral cascade on an arterial would predict clinical outcomes
we hypothesized that a comprehensive analysis of the cerebral collateral cascade on venous level would predict clinical outcomes
we hypothesized that a comprehensive analysis of the cerebral collateral cascade on an arterial would predict radiologic outcomes
we hypothesized that a comprehensive analysis of the cerebral collateral cascade on tissue would predict radiologic outcomes
we hypothesized that a comprehensive analysis of the cerebral collateral cascade on venous level would predict radiologic outcomes
we hypothesized that a comprehensive analysis of the cerebral collateral cascade on tissue would predict clinical outcomes
acute stroke undergoing thrombectomy triage
this was a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients with acute stroke
cerebral collateral cascade was determined by quantifying tissuelevel collaterals
cerebral collateral cascade was determined by quantifying venous outflow
cerebral collateral cascade was determined by quantifying pial arterial collaterals
pial arterial collaterals were determined by ct angiography tissuelevel collaterals were assessed on ct perfusion
venous outflow was assessed on ct angiography using the cortical vein opacification score
comprehensive assessment of the collateral blood flow cascade in patients with acute stroke is a strong predictor of clinical outcomes in patients
patients treated by thrombectomy
comprehensive assessment of the collateral blood flow cascade in patients with acute stroke is a strong predictor of radiologic outcomes in patients
