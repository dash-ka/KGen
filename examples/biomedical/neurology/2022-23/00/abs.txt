Robust cerebral collaterals are associated with favorable outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion treated by thrombectomy . However, collateral status assessment mostly relies on single imaging biomarkers and a more comprehensive holistic approach may provide deeper insights into the biology of collateral perfusion on medical imaging . Comprehensive collateralization is defined as blood flow of cerebral arteries through the brain tissue and into draining veins . We hypothesized that a comprehensive analysis of the cerebral collateral cascade on an arterial, tissue, and venous level would predict clinical and radiologic outcomes .

This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients with acute stroke undergoing thrombectomy triage . cerebral collateral cascade was determined by quantifying pial arterial collaterals, tissue-level collaterals, and venous outflow . Pial arterial collaterals were determined by CT angiography; tissue-level collaterals were assessed on CT perfusion. venous outflow was assessed on CT angiography using the cortical vein opacification score .



Comprehensive assessment of the collateral blood flow cascade in patients with acute stroke is a strong predictor of clinical and radiologic outcomes in patients treated by thrombectomy .
