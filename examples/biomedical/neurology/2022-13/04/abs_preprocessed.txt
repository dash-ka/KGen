although blood pressure control is considered the most effective measure to prevent functional decline after intracerebral hemorrhage fewer than half of survivors achieve treatment goals
we hypothesized that longterm hypertension severity may be a crucial factor in explaining poor blood pressure control after intracerebral hemorrhage
we investigated changes in hypertension severity after vs before intracerebral hemorrhage using latent class analysis and identified patient characteristics predictive of individuals blood pressure trajectories
we analyzed data for intracerebral hemorrhage survivors
a study conducted at massachusetts general hospital from 2002 to 2019 in a highresource setting with nearuniversal medical insurance coverage
intracerebral hemorrhage survivors enrolled in a study
a study conducted at massachusetts general hospital from 2002 to 2019 in boston
we captured blood pressure measurements in the 12 months following the acute intracerebral hemorrhage hospitalization
we captured blood pressure measurements in the 12 months preceding the acute intracerebral hemorrhage hospitalization
using latent class analysis we identified patient groups based on changes in hypertension severity over time in an unbiased manner
we then created multinomial logistic regression models to identify patient factors
patient factors associated with these classes
among 336 participants the average age was 744 years
3 patient classes corresponding to substantial improvement in hypertension severity after vs before intracerebral hemorrhage
3 patient classes corresponding to minimal intermediate
latent class analysis identified 3 patient classes
survivors with undertreated hypertension before intracerebral hemorrhage were less likely to experience substantial improvement afterwards
survivors with resistant hypertension before intracerebral hemorrhage were less likely to experience substantial improvement afterwards
residents of highincome neighborhoods were more likely to experience substantial improvement
black were more likely to experience minimal improvement after hemorrhagic stroke
asian participants with uncontrolled hypertension before intracerebral hemorrhage were more likely to experience minimal improvement after hemorrhagic stroke
hispanic were more likely to experience minimal improvement after hemorrhagic stroke
most intracerebral hemorrhage survivors do not display consistent improvement in hypertension severity after hemorrhagic stroke
blood pressure control after intracerebral hemorrhage is profoundly influenced by socioeconomic status
patient characteristics predating the hemorrhage
blood pressure control after intracerebral hemorrhage is profoundly influenced by chiefly prestroke hypertension severity
blood pressure control after intracerebral hemorrhage is profoundly influenced by patient characteristics
neighborhood income was associated with hypertension severity after intracerebral hemorrhage in a highresource setting with nearuniversal health care coverage
these findings likely contribute to previously documented racialethnic disparities in clinical outcomes following intracerebral hemorrhage
