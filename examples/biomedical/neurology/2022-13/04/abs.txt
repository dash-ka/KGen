Although blood pressure control is considered the most effective measure to prevent functional decline after intracerebral hemorrhage, fewer than half of survivors achieve treatment goals . We hypothesized that long-term hypertension severity may be a crucial factor in explaining poor blood pressure control after intracerebral hemorrhage . We investigated changes in hypertension severity after vs before intracerebral hemorrhage using latent class analysis and identified patient characteristics predictive of individuals blood pressure trajectories .

We analyzed data for intracerebral hemorrhage survivors enrolled in a study conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital from 2002 to 2019 in Boston, a high-resource setting with near-universal medical insurance coverage . We captured blood pressure measurements in the 12 months preceding and following the acute intracerebral hemorrhage hospitalization . Using latent class analysis, we identified patient groups based on changes in hypertension severity over time in an unbiased manner . We then created multinomial logistic regression models to identify patient factors associated with these classes .

Among 336 participants, the average age was 74.4 years . latent class analysis identified 3 patient classes, corresponding to minimal, intermediate, and substantial improvement in hypertension severity after vs before intracerebral hemorrhage . Survivors with undertreated or resistant hypertension before intracerebral hemorrhage were less likely to experience substantial improvement afterwards . Residents of high-income neighborhoods were more likely to experience substantial improvement . Black, Hispanic, and Asian participants with uncontrolled hypertension before intracerebral hemorrhage were more likely to experience minimal improvement after hemorrhagic stroke .

Most intracerebral hemorrhage survivors do not display consistent improvement in hypertension severity after hemorrhagic stroke . blood pressure control after intracerebral hemorrhage is profoundly influenced by patient characteristics predating the hemorrhage, chiefly prestroke hypertension severity and socioeconomic status . Neighborhood income was associated with hypertension severity after intracerebral hemorrhage in a high-resource setting with near-universal health care coverage . These findings likely contribute to previously documented racial/ethnic disparities in blood pressure control and clinical outcomes following intracerebral hemorrhage .
