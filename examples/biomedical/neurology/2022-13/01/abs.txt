Multiple biomarkers have been suggested to measure neurodegeneration in the ATN framework, leading to inconsistencies between studies . We investigated the association of 5 neurodegeneration biomarkers with clinical progression and cognitive decline in individuals with subjective cognitive decline .

We included individuals with subjective cognitive decline from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort and SCIENCe project, a longitudinal cohort study . 

We included 401 individuals .

In cognitively unimpaired older adults, correlations between different neurodegeneration biomarkers were only moderate, indicating they reflect different aspects of neurodegeneration and should not be used interchangeably . CSF total tau was strongly associated with CSF p-tau, which makes it less desirable to use as a measure for neurodegeneration . hippocampal volume, NfL, and GFAP predicted clinical progression beyond A and T . Our results do not allow to choose one most suitable biomarker for neurodegeneration, but illustrate the added prognostic value of neurodegeneration beyond A and T .
