neurodegeneration in the atn framework leading to inconsistencies between studies
multiple biomarkers have been suggested to measure neurodegeneration in the atn framework
we investigated the association of 5 neurodegeneration biomarkers with cognitive decline in individuals with subjective cognitive decline
we investigated the association of 5 neurodegeneration biomarkers with clinical progression in individuals with subjective cognitive decline
we included individuals with subjective cognitive decline from science project a longitudinal cohort study
we included individuals with subjective cognitive decline from the amsterdam dementia cohort a longitudinal cohort study
we included 401 individuals
in cognitively unimpaired older adults correlations between different neurodegeneration biomarkers were only moderate indicating biomarkers should not be used interchangeably
in cognitively unimpaired older adults correlations between different neurodegeneration biomarkers were only moderate indicating biomarkers reflect different aspects of neurodegeneration
csf total tau was strongly associated with csf ptau
csf ptau which makes csf total tau less desirable to use as a measure for neurodegeneration
hippocampal volume predicted clinical progression beyond a
nfl predicted clinical progression beyond a
gfap predicted clinical progression beyond a
gfap predicted t
hippocampal volume predicted t
nfl predicted t
we illustrate the added prognostic value of neurodegeneration beyond a
we illustrate the added prognostic value of t
we results do not allow to choose one most suitable biomarker for neurodegeneration
