cognitive resilience is a wellrecognized concept
instruments that identify older adults with low resilience
instruments that identify older adults with high resilience
knowledge gaps about a wellrecognized concept underlying mechanisms have made it difficult to develop instruments
we tested whether aggregating cortical peptides can identify adults with lower cognitive resilience
we tested whether aggregating cortical peptides can identify adults with higher cognitive resilience
cortical peptides associated with cognitive resilience into an index
we used data from 1192 older decedents including indices of 10 alzheimer disease
we used data from 1192 older decedents including alzheimer disease related dementia pathologies
226 proteotypic peptides measured in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex
we used data from 1192 older decedents including annual clinical testing
peptides that were related to cognitive resilience
we used linear mixedeffects models to identify peptides

we aggregated the expression levels of 226 proteotypic peptides into a personspecific cognitive resilience index and examined a personspecific cognitive resilience index association with 10 alzheimer pathologic phenotypes
226 peptides related to cognitive resilience
we constructed a resilience index from 52 of 226 peptides
a higher index was associated with slower cognitive decline
a higher index was associated with slower motor decline
30 percent also provided resilience for motor decline
most resilience peptides were specific to cognitive decline
a higher index was also related to a lower burden of alzheimer disease pathologies and modified the association of alzheimer disease pathology with cognition in that a higher index modified the negative effects of alzheimer disease pathology on alzheimer disease dementia proximate to death
up to 90 percent of cognitive resilience peptides were related to alzheimer disease pathologic phenotypes
these multifunctional proteins may provide some degree of cognitive resilience
these multifunctional proteins also seem to provide resilience to other alzheimer disease clinical phenotypes and have independent associations with 10 alzheimer disease related dementia pathologies

resilience proteins may be highvalue therapeutic targets for drug discovery of interventionsneurodegeneration in the atn framework leading to inconsistencies between studies

thus the primary objective of this cohort study was to determine the association of loneliness with 10year allbecause dementia risk
this was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the populationbased framingham study cohorts
loneliness assessed
eligible participants were dementiafree at baseline
eligible participants had loneliness
loneliness was recorded with the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale defined conservatively as feeling lonely over 3 days in the past week
the main outcomes were incident dementia over a 10year period cognition and mri brain volumes and white matter injury
of 2308 participants 14 percent developed 6 percent were lonely
2308 participants who met eligibility in the dementia sample

these findings may have important clinical given observed loneliness trends
these findings may have public health implications given observed loneliness trendsalthough blood pressure control is considered the most effective measure to prevent functional decline after intracerebral hemorrhage fewer than half of survivors achieve treatment goals
we hypothesized that longterm hypertension severity may be a crucial factor in explaining poor blood pressure control after intracerebral hemorrhage
we investigated changes in hypertension severity after vs before intracerebral hemorrhage using latent class analysis and identified patient characteristics predictive of individuals blood pressure trajectories
we analyzed data for intracerebral hemorrhage survivors

we captured blood pressure measurements in the 12 months following the acute intracerebral hemorrhage hospitalization
we captured blood pressure measurements in the 12 months preceding the acute intracerebral hemorrhage hospitalization
using latent class analysis we identified patient groups based on changes in hypertension severity over time in an unbiased manner
we then created multinomial logistic regression models to identify patient factors
patient factors associated with these classes
among 336 participants the average age was 744 years
3 patient classes corresponding to substantial improvement in hypertension severity after vs before intracerebral hemorrhage
3 patient classes corresponding to minimal intermediate
latent class analysis identified 3 patient classes
survivors with undertreated hypertension before intracerebral hemorrhage were less likely to experience substantial improvement afterwards
survivors with resistant hypertension before intracerebral hemorrhage were less likely to experience substantial improvement afterwards
residents of highincome neighborhoods were more likely to experience substantial improvement
black were more likely to experience minimal improvement after hemorrhagic stroke
asian participants with uncontrolled hypertension before intracerebral hemorrhage were more likely to experience minimal improvement after hemorrhagic stroke
hispanic were more likely to experience minimal improvement after hemorrhagic stroke
most intracerebral hemorrhage survivors do not display consistent improvement in hypertension severity after hemorrhagic stroke
blood pressure control after intracerebral hemorrhage is profoundly influenced by socioeconomic status
patient characteristics predating the hemorrhage
blood pressure control after intracerebral hemorrhage is profoundly influenced by chiefly prestroke hypertension severity
blood pressure control after intracerebral hemorrhage is profoundly influenced by patient characteristics
neighborhood income was associated with hypertension severity after intracerebral hemorrhage in a highresource setting with nearuniversal health care coverage
