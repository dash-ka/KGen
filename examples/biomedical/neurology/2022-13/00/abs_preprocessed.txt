cognitive resilience is a wellrecognized concept
instruments that identify older adults with low resilience
instruments that identify older adults with high resilience
knowledge gaps about a wellrecognized concept underlying mechanisms have made it difficult to develop instruments
we tested whether aggregating cortical peptides can identify adults with lower cognitive resilience
we tested whether aggregating cortical peptides can identify adults with higher cognitive resilience
cortical peptides associated with cognitive resilience into an index
we used data from 1192 older decedents including indices of 10 alzheimer disease
we used data from 1192 older decedents including alzheimer disease related dementia pathologies
226 proteotypic peptides measured in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex
we used data from 1192 older decedents including annual clinical testing
peptides that were related to cognitive resilience
we used linear mixedeffects models to identify peptides
we aggregated the expression levels of 226 proteotypic peptides into a personspecific cognitive resilience index and examined a personspecific cognitive resilience index association with 10 alzheimer disease clinical
we aggregated the expression levels of 226 proteotypic peptides into a personspecific cognitive resilience index and examined a personspecific cognitive resilience index association with 10 alzheimer pathologic phenotypes
226 peptides related to cognitive resilience
we constructed a resilience index from 52 of 226 peptides
a higher index was associated with slower cognitive decline
a higher index was associated with slower motor decline
30 percent also provided resilience for motor decline
most resilience peptides were specific to cognitive decline
a higher index was also related to a lower burden of alzheimer disease pathologies and modified the association of alzheimer disease pathology with cognition in that a higher index modified the negative effects of alzheimer disease pathology on alzheimer disease dementia proximate to death
up to 90 percent of cognitive resilience peptides were related to alzheimer disease pathologic phenotypes
these multifunctional proteins may provide some degree of cognitive resilience
these multifunctional proteins also seem to provide resilience to other alzheimer disease clinical phenotypes and have independent associations with 10 alzheimer disease related dementia pathologies
interventions that maintain brain health in aging adults via multiple pathways
resilience proteins may be highvalue therapeutic targets for drug discovery of interventions
