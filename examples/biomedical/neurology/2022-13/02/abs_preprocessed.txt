objective memory impairment system operationalized with the free and cued selective reminding test
objective memory impairment system operationalized with the free and cued a widely used episodic memory measure
the goal of this work was to investigate the neuroimaging correlates of the stages of objective memory impairment system
unique semantic cues that are used in the test phase to prompt recall of items
a study phase in which items are identified in response to unique semantic cues
the free and cued selective reminding test begins with a study phase not retrieved by free recall
there are 3 test trials of the 16 items
data from 4484 cognitively unimpaired participants from the antiamyloid treatment in asymptomatic alzheimer study were used
a subset of the betaamyloid had structural mris
all participants had amyloid pet imaging
we compared the betaamyloid mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio of entorhinal cortex
we compared the betaamyloid mean volumetric measures of parahippocampal gyrus
we compared the betaamyloid mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio of inferior temporal cortex between the 5 stages of objective memory impairment stages
we compared the betaamyloid mean volumetric measures of entorhinal cortex
we compared the betaamyloid mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio of parahippocampal gyrus
we compared the betaamyloid mean volumetric measures of inferior temporal cortex between the 5 stages of objective memory impairment stages
we compared the betaamyloid mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio of hippocampus
we compared the betaamyloid mean volumetric measures of hippocampus
participants had a mean age of 713 years
half had no memory impairment
the other half had retrieval deficits
the other half had both
the other half had storage limitations
analysis of covariance in the entire sample while controlling for apoe epsilon4 showed that individuals in higher stages of objective memory impairment stages had higher global amyloid standardized uptake value ratio
analysis of covariance in the entire sample while controlling for age showed that individuals in higher stages of objective memory impairment stages had higher global amyloid standardized uptake value ratio
analysis of covariance in the entire sample while controlling for education showed that individuals in higher stages of objective memory impairment stages had higher global amyloid standardized uptake value ratio
analysis of covariance in the entire sample while controlling for sex showed that individuals in higher stages of objective memory impairment stages had higher global amyloid standardized uptake value ratio
both stages of objective memory impairment4 had higher amyloid standardized uptake value ratio than stages of objective memory impairment0
both stages of objective memory impairment3 subgroups had stages of objective memory impairment1 subgroups
both stages of objective memory impairment4 had stages of objective memory impairment1 subgroups
both stages of objective memory impairment3 subgroups had higher amyloid standardized uptake value ratio than stages of objective memory impairment0
individuals in higher stages of objective memory impairment stages had inferior temporal lobes
there was no difference between parahippocampal gyrus volume of different stages of objective memory impairment stages
individuals in higher stages of objective memory impairment stages had entorhinal cortex
individuals in higher stages of objective memory impairment stages had smaller hippocampal volume
pairwise comparison of stages of objective memory impairment subgroups showed that the stages of objective memory impairment4 had smaller hippocampal volume than the stages of objective memory impairment0
pairwise comparison of stages of objective memory impairment subgroups showed that the stages of objective memory impairment2 subgroups had smaller hippocampal volume than the stages of objective memory impairment1 subgroup
pairwise comparison of stages of objective memory impairment subgroups showed that the stages of objective memory impairment4 had smaller hippocampal volume than the stages of objective memory impairment1 subgroup
pairwise comparison of stages of objective memory impairment subgroups showed that the stages of objective memory impairment3 had smaller hippocampal volume than the stages of objective memory impairment1 subgroup
pairwise comparison of stages of objective memory impairment subgroups showed that the stages of objective memory impairment2 subgroups had smaller hippocampal volume than the stages of objective memory impairment0
pairwise comparison of stages of objective memory impairment subgroups showed that the stages of objective memory impairment3 had smaller hippocampal volume than the stages of objective memory impairment0
the stages of objective memory impairment4 subgroup had smaller inferior temporal lobe compared to all other groups
the stages of objective memory impairment4 subgroup had significantly smaller entorhinal cortex compared to all other groups
presence of alzheimer disease pathology is closely related to memory impairment according to stages of objective memory impairment stages in the cognitively unimpaired sample of a4
results from structural mris suggest that memory storage impairment is present when there is widespread medial temporal lobe atrophy
