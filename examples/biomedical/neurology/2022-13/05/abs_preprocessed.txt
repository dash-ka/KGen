current guidelines recommend the use of mechanical thrombectomy
current guidelines recommend iv thrombolysis for patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion stroke
however clinical equipoise exists in relation to the use of bridging mechanical thrombectomy alone
however clinical equipoise exists in relation to the use of bridging therapy alone
our objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of bridging mechanical thrombectomy for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion

a systematic search of biomedical literature databases was performed from inception to october 29 2021 to identify retrospective studies comparing the rates for functional independence and mortality at 90 days
a systematic search of biomedical literature databases was performed from inception to october 29 2021 to identify prospective studies bridging therapy
a systematic search of biomedical literature databases was performed from inception to october 29 2021 to identify prospective studies comparing the rates for functional independence and mortality at successful recanalization rates for mechanical thrombectomy

effect size was represented by odds ratio
analysis was done with randomeffects metaanalysis
heterogeneity was assessed by i2 q statistics
heterogeneity was assessed by cochrane q statistics
overall 41 studies with 14885 patients were included
41 studies with 14885 patients used alteplase as the thrombolytic agent
the bridging therapy group had 29 percent higher odds for functional independence 25 percent higher odds of successful reperfusion and 31 percent decrease in odds for mortality compared with mechanical thrombectomy
symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage prevalence was similar between groups
six of the studies were randomized controlled trials with intentiontotreat analysis
intentiontotreat analysis done in patients
patients presenting directly to mechanical thrombectomycapable centers
these 6 randomized controlled trials
when analysis was restricted to these 6 no differences were observed in functional independence
when analysis was restricted to these 6 no differences were observed in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage
when analysis was restricted to these 6 no differences were observed in mortality between groups
however successful reperfusion favored the bridging therapy group
the odds for mortality for the entire dataset favored the use of bridging therapy over mechanical thrombectomy
the odds for successful reperfusion favored the use of bridging therapy over mechanical thrombectomy
the odds for functional independence favored the use of bridging therapy over mechanical thrombectomy
when analysis was restricted to randomized controlled trials both treatments had similar safety outcomes
recanalization rates favored the bridging therapy group
when analysis was restricted to randomized controlled trials both treatments had similar functional outcomes
patients who present to nonmechanical thrombectomycapable centers
because these findings may differ with the use of other thrombolytic agents further randomized controlled trials are needed
because these findings may differ in patients controlled trials are needed
