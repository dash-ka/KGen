loneliness is common
its prevalence prevalence is rising
the relationship of the early preclinical course of alzheimer disease related dementia remains unclear
the relationship of loneliness with subsequent dementia remains unclear
thus the primary objective of this cohort study was to determine the association of loneliness with neuroanatomic imaging markers of alzheimer disease related dementia vulnerability
thus the primary objective of this cohort study was to determine the association of loneliness with early cognitive related dementia vulnerability
thus the primary objective of this cohort study was to determine the association of loneliness with 10year allbecause dementia risk
this was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the populationbased framingham study cohorts
loneliness assessed
eligible participants were dementiafree at baseline
eligible participants had loneliness
loneliness was recorded with the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale defined conservatively as feeling lonely over 3 days in the past week
the main outcomes were incident dementia over a 10year period cognition and mri brain volumes and white matter injury
of 2308 participants 14 percent developed 6 percent were lonely
2308 participants who met eligibility in the dementia sample
of 2308 participants 14 percent developed dementia were lonely
lonely adults had higher 10year dementia risk
lonely participants younger than 80 years of age without apoe epsilon4 alleles had a 3fold greater risk
among 1875 persons without dementia loneliness associated with lower total cerebral volume
among 1875 persons without dementia loneliness associated with poorer executive function
among 1875 persons without dementia loneliness associated with greater white matter injury
dementia who met eligibility in the cognition sample
over 10 years of close clinical dementia surveillance in this cohort study loneliness was associated with increased dementia risk
this tripled in adults whose baseline risk would otherwise be relatively low on the basis of genetic risk representing a majority of the us population
this tripled in adults whose baseline risk would otherwise be relatively low on the basis of age risk representing a majority of the us population
loneliness was also associated with worse neurocognitive markers of alzheimer disease related dementia vulnerability suggesting an early pathogenic role
these findings may have important clinical given observed loneliness trends
these findings may have public health implications given observed loneliness trends
