Loneliness is common, and its prevalence is rising . The relationship of loneliness with subsequent dementia and the early preclinical course of Alzheimer disease related dementia remains unclear . Thus, the primary objective of this study was to determine the association of loneliness with 10-year all-cause dementia risk and early cognitive and neuroanatomic imaging markers of Alzheimer disease related dementia vulnerability .

This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the population-based Framingham Study cohorts . Eligible participants had loneliness assessed and were dementia-free at baseline . Loneliness was recorded with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, defined conservatively as feeling lonely over 3 days in the past week . The main outcomes were incident dementia over a 10-year period, cognition, and MRI brain volumes and white matter injury .

Of 2,308 participants who met eligibility in the dementia sample, 14 percent developed dementia and 6 percent were lonely . Lonely adults had higher 10-year dementia risk . Lonely participants younger than 80 years of age without APOE Epsilon4 alleles had a 3-fold greater risk . Among 1,875 persons without dementia who met eligibility in the cognition sample, loneliness associated with poorer executive function, lower total cerebral volume, and greater white matter injury .

Over 10 years of close clinical dementia surveillance in this cohort study, loneliness was associated with increased dementia risk . this tripled in adults whose baseline risk would otherwise be relatively low on the basis of age and genetic risk, representing a majority of the US population . Loneliness was also associated with worse neurocognitive markers of Alzheimer disease related dementia vulnerability, suggesting an early pathogenic role . These findings may have important clinical and public health implications given observed loneliness trends .
