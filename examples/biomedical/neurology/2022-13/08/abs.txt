Enhancing resident well-being has become a top priority for medical educators as awareness of physician burnout continues to grow . Although substantial effort has been made to understand contributors to resident burnout and develop effective interventions, relatively little is known about what characterizes the opposite of burnoutâ€”that is, thriving in medical training . This phenomenologic qualitative study applies appreciative inquiry as an interview technique with the aim of characterizing self-identified experiences of thriving among residents in the Yale Neurology program .

Eight residents across all years of training in a single neurology residency participated in semi-structured appreciative interviews to identify experiences of thriving during neurology training . These interviews were transcribed and qualitatively analyzed with a phenomenologic perspective for common themes .

Numerous themes emerged spanning personal, interpersonal, and organizational domains . Whereas some of these themes were congruent with established foundations of well-being and adult learning theory, others revealed the crucial contributions of stress and challenge to thriving . One of the strongest emergent themes was the tendency of residents to thrive during autonomous, high-challenge, high-stress situations, provided that adequate support was present and psychological safety was ensured .

These findings resonate with phenomena studied in positive psychology that are not being widely applied in medical education . To the degree that conclusions are transferable to other training contexts, this study suggests an opportunity for medical educators to harness the positive aspects of stress and challenge in a supportive way that facilitates trainee well-being through experiences of thriving .
