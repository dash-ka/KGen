to evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting highly differentiated t cells in patients with inclusion body myositis by establishing highresolution mapping of killer cell lectinlike receptor subfamily g member 1 within the t
blood was collected from 51 patients with inclusion body myositis
blood was collected from 51 patients with 19 healthy agematched donors
peripheral blood mononuclear cells were interrogated by flow cytometry using a 12marker antibody panel
a 12marker antibody panel allowed total based on the differential expression of cd16
a 12marker antibody panel allowed total based on the differential expression of c56
a 12marker antibody panel allowed the delineation of naive t cells central memory t cells based on the differential expression of cd16
a 12marker antibody panel allowed subpopulations of natural killer cells based on the differential expression of c56
a 12marker antibody panel allowed effector memory reexpressing cd45ra t cells based on the differential expression of cd16
a 12marker antibody panel allowed effector memory reexpressing cd45ra t cells based on the differential expression of c56
a 12marker antibody panel allowed subpopulations of natural killer cells based on the differential expression of cd16
a 12marker antibody panel allowed the delineation of naive t cells central memory t cells based on the differential expression of c56
a 12marker antibody panel allowed 4 stages of effector memory differentiation t cells based on the differential expression of cd16
a 12marker antibody panel allowed 4 stages of effector memory differentiation t cells based on the differential expression of c56
we found that a population of killer cell lectinlike receptor subfamily g member 1 effector memory differentiation t cells were expanded in both the cd4 in patients with inclusion body myositis
we found that a population of effector memory reexpressing cd45ra t cells were expanded in both cd8 tcell subpopulations in patients with inclusion body myositis

the frequency of killer cell lectinlike receptor subfamily g member 1 total natural killer cells and subpopulations did not differ between patients with healthy donors
the frequency of killer cell lectinlike receptor subfamily g member 1 total natural killer cells and subpopulations did not differ between patients with inclusion body myositis
inclusion body myositis disease duration correlated with increased cd8 tcell differentiation
we findings reveal that the selective expansion of blood killer cell lectinlike receptor subfamily g member 1 t cells in patients with inclusion body myositis is confined to the effector memory reexpressing cd45ra t cells cellular compartments
