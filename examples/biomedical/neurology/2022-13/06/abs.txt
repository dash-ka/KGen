To evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting highly differentiated T cells in patients with inclusion body myositis by establishing high-resolution mapping of killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 within the T and natural killer cell compartments .

Blood was collected from 51 patients with inclusion body myositis and 19 healthy age-matched donors . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were interrogated by flow cytometry using a 12-marker antibody panel . The panel allowed the delineation of naive T cells, central memory T cells, 4 stages of effector memory differentiation T cells, and effector memory re-expressing CD45RA T cells, as well as total and subpopulations of natural killer cells based on the differential expression of CD16 and C56 .

We found that a population of killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 effector memory differentiation T cells and effector memory re-expressing CD45RA T cells were expanded in both the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subpopulations in patients with inclusion body myositis . KLRG1 expression in CD8+ T cells increased with T-cell differentiation with the lowest levels of expression in naive T cells and highest in highly differentiated effector memory re-expressing CD45RA T cells and CD56+CD8+ T cells . The frequency of killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 total natural killer cells and subpopulations did not differ between patients with inclusion body myositis and healthy donors . inclusion body myositis disease duration correlated with increased CD8+ T-cell differentiation .

Our findings reveal that the selective expansion of blood killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 T cells in patients with inclusion body myositis is confined to the effector memory re-expressing CD45RA T cells and effector memory differentiation T cells cellular compartments .
