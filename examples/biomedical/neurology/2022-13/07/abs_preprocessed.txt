we also compared expression levels of dermal fibroblasts in those with confirmed facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2
we also compared expression levels of dermal fibroblasts in these individuals with confirmed facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2
we also compared expression levels of pathogenic dux4 mrna in primary myoblasts with confirmed facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2
among the 11 individuals with rare pathogenic heterozygous missense variants in exons 311 of smchd1 only a subset met the strict genetic for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2
among the 11 individuals with rare pathogenic heterozygous missense variants in exons 311 of smchd1 only a subset met epigenetic criteria for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2
none of the 3 individuals had typical clinical manifestations
none of the 3 individuals had muscle imaging findings consistent with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2
however the patients with epigenetic criteria for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 displayed some dux4 expression in dermal fibroblasts under the epigenetic derepression in the primary myoblasts
however the patients with epigenetic criteria for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 displayed some dux4 expression in dermal fibroblasts under the epigenetic derepression by drug treatment
however the patients with arhinia meeting the permissive genetic displayed some dux4 expression in dermal fibroblasts under the epigenetic derepression in the primary myoblasts

the primary myoblasts undergoing myogenic differentiation
in this crosssectional study we identified patients with arhinia who meet the full epigenetic criteria for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2
in this crosssectional study we identified patients with arhinia who display the molecular hallmark of fshd dux4 derepression and expression in vitro
in this crosssectional study we identified patients with arhinia who do not manifest with the typical clinicopathologic phenotype of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2
in this crosssectional study we identified patients with arhinia who meet the full genetic criteria for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2
the distinct dichotomy between arhinia phenotypes despite an otherwise poised dux4 locus implies the presence of novel diseasemodifying factors
the distinct dichotomy between facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 implies the presence of novel diseasemodifying factors
novel diseasemodifying factors that seem to operate as a switch resulting in not the other
novel diseasemodifying factors that seem to operate as a switch resulting in one phenotype
further understanding of these diseasemodifying factors will provide valuable insight with therapeutic implications for both diseases
