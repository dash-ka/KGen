123imetaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy is used as a diagnostic imaging test to differentiate lewy body diseases  from other similar diseases
123imetaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy is used as a diagnostic imaging test to differentiate parkinson disease and dementia with lewy bodies from other similar diseases
however a diagnostic imaging test lacks validation of a diagnostic imaging test diagnostic accuracy against the gold standard
our aim was to validate the diagnostic accuracy of 123imetaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy for lewy body disease against autopsy 
our aim was to validate the diagnostic accuracy of 123imetaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy for lewy body disease against the gold standard
this retrospective crosssectional study included consecutive autopsy patients from the brain bank for aging research
aging research who had undergone 123imetaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy
our compared 123imetaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy myocardial scintigraphy findings with autopsy findings
furthermore the proportion of residual tyrosine hydroxylaseimmunoreactive sympathetic fibers in the anterior wall of the left ventricle was investigated to assess the condition of the cardiac sympathetic nerves assumed to because reduced 123imetaiodobenzylguanidine uptake in lewy body diseases
our analyzed the data of 56 patients
compared with the neuropathologic diagnosis the early hearttomediastinum ratio had a sensitivity and specificity of 70 percent
compared with the neuropathologic diagnosis the early hearttomediastinum ratio had 962 percent respectively
the early hearttomediastinum ratio had 923 percent respectively
the early hearttomediastinum ratio had a sensitivity and specificity of 80 percent
the washout rate had a sensitivity and specificity of 80 percent
the washout rate had 846 percent respectively
cardiac 123imetaiodobenzylguanidine uptake when assessed with early hearttomediastinum ratio values
cardiac 123imetaiodobenzylguanidine uptake when assessed with delayed hearttomediastinum ratio values
the proportion of residual tyrosine hydroxylaseimmunoreactive cardiac sympathetic fibers strongly correlated with the amount of cardiac 123imetaiodobenzylguanidine uptake
this retrospective crosssectional study revealed that 123imetaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy could robustly differentiate lewy body diseases from similar diseases
abnormal 123imetaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy findings strongly support the presence of cardiac sympathetic denervation
abnormal 123imetaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy findings strongly support the presence of lewy body disease
normal myocardial scintigraphy results especially when other biomarkers suggest the presence of comorbid alzheimer disease pathology
however lewy body disease pathology should not necessarily be excluded by normal myocardial scintigraphy results
