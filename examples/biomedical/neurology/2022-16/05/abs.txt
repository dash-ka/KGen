123I-meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine myocardial scintigraphy is used as a diagnostic imaging test to differentiate Lewy body diseases, including Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, from other similar diseases . However, this imaging test lacks validation of its diagnostic accuracy against the gold standard . Our aim was to validate the diagnostic accuracy of 123I-meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine myocardial scintigraphy for Lewy body disease against autopsy, the gold standard .

This retrospective, cross-sectional study included consecutive autopsy patients from the Brain Bank for Aging Research who had undergone 123I-meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine myocardial scintigraphy . We compared the 123I-meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine myocardial scintigraphy findings with autopsy findings . Furthermore, the proportion of residual tyrosine hydroxylaseâ€“immunoreactive sympathetic fibers in the anterior wall of the left ventricle was investigated to assess the condition of the cardiac sympathetic nerves assumed to cause reduced 123I-meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine uptake in Lewy body diseases .

We analyzed the data of 56 patients . Compared with the neuropathologic diagnosis, the early heart-to-mediastinum ratio had a sensitivity and specificity of 70 percent and 96.2 percent, respectively . The delayed heart-to-mediastinum ratio had a sensitivity and specificity of 80 percent and 92.3 percent, respectively . The washout rate had a sensitivity and specificity of 80 percent and 84.6 percent, respectively . The proportion of residual tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cardiac sympathetic fibers strongly correlated with the amount of cardiac 123I-meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine uptake when assessed with early and delayed heart-to-mediastinum ratio values .

This clinicopathologic validation study revealed that 123I-meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine myocardial scintigraphy could robustly differentiate Lewy body diseases from similar diseases . Abnormal 123I-meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine myocardial scintigraphy findings strongly support the presence of Lewy body disease and cardiac sympathetic denervation . However, Lewy body disease pathology should not necessarily be excluded by normal myocardial scintigraphy results, especially when other biomarkers suggest the presence of comorbid Alzheimer disease pathology .
