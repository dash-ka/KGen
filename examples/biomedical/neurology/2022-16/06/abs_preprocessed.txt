hypertriglyceridemia is perceived to promote atherosclerotic pathology
its role in stroke has not been well defined
our aim was to assess the contribution of hypertriglyceridemia to residual vascular risk in patients with atherothrombotic stroke
the tokyo womens medical university stroke registry is an ongoing prospective observational registry
an ongoing prospective observational registry in which 870 patients with acute ischemic stroke or tia within 1 week of onset were followed up for 1 year
an ongoing prospective observational registry in which 870 patients with acute ischemic stroke or tia within 1 week of onset were consecutively enrolled
hypertriglyceridemia was defined as serum triglycerides levels of over 150 mgdl under fasting conditions
significant stenosis of the cervicocephalic arteries was defined as having occlusion
significant stenosis of the cervicocephalic arteries was defined as having over 50 percent stenosis
the primary outcome was nonfatal acute coronary syndrome
the primary outcome was vascular death
the primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events
the primary outcome was nonfatal stroke
of 870 patients 217 had hypertriglyceridemia
high triglycerides levels were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of intracranial artery stenosis particularly in extracranial artery stenosis
high triglycerides levels were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of intracranial artery stenosis particularly in the anterior circulation
patients with hypertriglyceridemia had the higher risk of vascular events in patients with hypertriglyceridemia vs without hypertriglyceridemia was observed among patients with those with significant intracranial artery stenosis
patients with hypertriglyceridemia had the higher risk of vascular events in patients with hypertriglyceridemia vs without hypertriglyceridemia was observed among patients with those with significant extracranial carotid artery stenosis
patients with hypertriglyceridemia had the higher risk of vascular events in patients with hypertriglyceridemia vs without hypertriglyceridemia was observed among patients with stroke of atherothrombotic origin
without even after adjustment for potential confounders including baseline lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol
without even after adjustment for potential confounders including statin use
the higher risk of vascular events in patients with hypertriglyceridemia vs without hypertriglyceridemia was observed among patients with stroke of atherothrombotic origin
the higher risk of vascular events in patients with hypertriglyceridemia vs without hypertriglyceridemia was observed among patients with those with significant extracranial carotid artery stenosis
the higher risk of vascular events in patients with hypertriglyceridemia vs without hypertriglyceridemia was observed among patients with those with significant intracranial artery stenosis
in contrast hypertriglyceridemia was not predictive of recurrent vascular events in patients with cardioembolic stroke
an important modifiable risk factor that drives residual vascular risk in patients with stroke of atherothrombotic origin even while on statin therapy
hypertriglyceridemia is an important modifiable risk factor
