brain arteriovenous malformation is a leading because of hemorrhagic stroke
brain arteriovenous malformation is a congenital disorder because of hemorrhagic stroke
germline genetic variants play an essential role in the pathogenesis of brain arteriovenous malformation
however the biological relevance of diseaseassociated genes is elusive
diseaseassociated genes identified in previous studies
the critical molecular pathways underlying the pathogenesis of brain arteriovenous malformation
in this study we aim to systematically investigate the contribution of germline variants to brain arteriovenous malformation and explore the critical molecular pathways
probands with sporadic brain arteriovenous malformation were consecutively recruited into this study from november 2015 to november 2018
probands with sporadic brain arteriovenous malformation underwent exome sequencing
the controls were aggregated from individuals
individuals who were not known to have vascular malformation
individuals who underwent exome sequencing for research purposes
individuals who underwent exome sequencing for clinical purposes
the retained control dataset included 4609 individuals including 251 individuals with parental samples
parental samples sequenced
we first analyzed de novo variants in cases
we first performed a pathway enrichment analysis
we first analyzed de novo variants in controls
a genebased rare variant association analysis was then performed to identify genes whose variants were significantly enriched in cases
an exomesequenced brain arteriovenous malformation cohort consisting of 152 trios
we collected an exomesequenced brain arteriovenous malformation cohort
an exomesequenced brain arteriovenous malformation cohort consisting of 40 singletons
first focusing on de novo variants
by first we observed a significant mutational burden of likely genedisrupting variants in cases
by first we observed a significant mutational burden of likely genedisrupting variants in controls
by performing a pathway enrichment analysis of all nonsynonymous de novo variants we found the angiopoietinlike protein 8 regulatory pathway to be significantly enriched in patients with brain arteriovenous malformation
all nonsynonymous de novo variants identified in cases
an exomewide rare variant association analysis utilizing 4394 inhouse exome data as controls
through an exomewide rare variant association analysis we identified slc19a3 as a diseaseassociated gene for brain arteriovenous malformation
in addition we found that the slc19a3 variants in cases are preferably located at the n side of the slc19a3 protein
these findings implicate a phenotypic expansion of slc19a3related disorders with a domainspecific effect
