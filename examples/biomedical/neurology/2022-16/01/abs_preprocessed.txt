agerelated cognitive impairment is driven by the complex interplay of neurovascular disease
agerelated cognitive impairment is driven by the complex interplay of neurodegenerative disease
the cognitive decline observed in conditions such as disease
there is the cognitive decline
there is cerebral amyloid angiopathy
there is a strong relationship between cerebral microbleeds
however in the early preclinical phase of cognitive impairment the extent to which cerebral microbleeds angiopathy affect volumetric changes in the brain related to neurodegenerative disease remains unclear

we performed crosssectional analyses from the northern manhattan study in singapore study
we performed crosssectional analyses from 3 large cohorts in singapore study
we performed crosssectional analyses from alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative in singapore study
we performed crosssectional analyses from the epidemiology of dementia in singapore study
we conducted a confirmatory analysis of 82 autopsied cases from northern manhattan study
we implemented multivariate regression analyses to study the association between 2 related markers of cerebrovascular disease autopsybased cerebral amyloid angiopathy  as independent variables as dependent variables
we implemented multivariate regression analyses to study the association between 2 related markers of cerebrovascular disease mribased cerebral microbleeds  as independent variables as dependent variables
we implemented multivariate regression analyses to study the association between 2 related markers of volumetric markers of neurodegeneration as dependent variables
northern manhattan study included mostly dementiafree participants age 55 years from northern manhattan
northern manhattan study included mostly dementiafree participants age older from northern manhattan
alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative disease included participants living in the united states age 55 to 90 years with a range of cognitive status
epidemiology of dementia in singapore included communitybased participants older with a range of cognitive status
epidemiology of dementia in singapore included communitybased participants living in singapore age 60 years
brain arterial remodeling study included postmortem pathologic samples
we included 2657 participants with 82 autopsy cases from brain arterial remodeling study
we included 2657 participants with available mri data from brain arterial remodeling study
in a metaanalysis of northern manhattan study superficial cerebral microbleeds were associated with larger gray matter
in a metaanalysis of alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative disease superficial cerebral microbleeds were associated with larger gray matter
in a metaanalysis of northern manhattan study superficial cerebral microbleeds were associated with white matter volumes
in a metaanalysis of alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative disease superficial cerebral microbleeds were associated with white matter volumes
in a metaanalysis of epidemiology of dementia in singapore singapore superficial cerebral microbleeds were associated with white matter volumes
in a metaanalysis of epidemiology of dementia in singapore singapore superficial cerebral microbleeds were associated with larger gray matter
the association between larger white matter volume was more evident in participants with 1 cerebral microbleed than in those with over 2 cerebral microbleeds
the association between superficial cerebral microbleeds was more evident in participants with 1 cerebral microbleed than in those with over 2 cerebral microbleeds
in brain arterial remodeling study cerebral amyloid angiopathy was associated with increased cortical thickness
in brain arterial remodeling study cerebral amyloid angiopathy was associated with increased brain weight
superficial cerebral microbleeds are associated with larger morphometric brain measures specifically white matter volume
strongest in brains with fewer cerebral microbleeds suggesting that the cerebral microbleedcerebral amyloid angiopathy contribution to neurodegeneration may not relate to tissue loss at least in early stages of disease
the association between larger white matter volume is strongest in brains with fewer cerebral microbleeds
the association between superficial cerebral microbleeds is strongest in brains with fewer cerebral microbleeds
