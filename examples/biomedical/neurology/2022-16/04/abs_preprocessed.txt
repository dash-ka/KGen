rasmitogenactivated protein kinase signaling abnormalities occur in most brain arteriovenous malformations
no means exist to molecularly profile brain arteriovenous malformations without open surgery limiting precision medicine approaches to treatment
here we report use of endoluminal biopsy of the vessel lumen of brain arteriovenous malformations to characterize gene expression and blood flowmediated transcriptional changes in living patients
endoluminal biopsy were performed in adults with unruptured avms with cerebral angiography
computational fluid dynamic modeling were performed in adults with unruptured avms with cerebral angiography
each patient underwent surgical resection from a contiguous arterial segment
each patient underwent cell sampling from a contiguous arterial segment
fluorescenceassisted cell sorting enriched endothelial cells
enriched endothelial cells which were sequenced on an illumina hiseq 4000 sequencer
gene expression was quantified with rna sequencing
differential gene expression were performed
ontology were performed
correlative analyses were performed
results were validated with quantitative reverse transcription pcr
endoluminal biopsy was successful in 4 patients without complication
endoluminal biopsy yielded 269 cells per biopsy
rnaseq identified 106 differentially expressed genes in brain arteriovenous malformations
differentially expressed genes were enriched for bavm pathogenic cascades  extracellular signalregulated kinase inhibitor response
differentially expressed genes were confirmed with reverse transcription pcr extracellular signalregulated kinase inhibitor response
differentially expressed genes were confirmed with a panel predictive of mitogenactivated protein kinase
differentially expressed genes were enriched for rasmitogenactivated protein kinase signaling extracellular signalregulated kinase inhibitor response
differentially expressed genes were confirmed with a panel extracellular signalregulated kinase inhibitor response
differentially expressed genes were enriched for rasmitogenactivated protein kinase signaling predictive of mitogenactivated protein kinase
differentially expressed genes were confirmed with reverse transcription pcr predictive of mitogenactivated protein kinase
differentially expressed genes were enriched for bavm pathogenic cascades  predictive of mitogenactivated protein kinase
genomewide expression strongly correlated
endoluminal biopsy detected 833 percent of genes
compared to patientmatched surgically excised tissues
wall shear stress measured by fluid dynamic modeling
wall shear stress correlated with inflammatory pathway upregulation
comparison of postembolization samples confirmed flowmediated gene expression changes
comparison of preembolization samples confirmed flowmediated gene expression changes
endoluminal biopsy allows molecular profiling of brain arteriovenous malformations in living patients
gene expression profiles are similar to those of tissues acquired with open surgery
gene expression profiles are similar to those of tissues identify potentially targetable rasmitogenactivated protein kinase signaling abnormalities in brain arteriovenous malformations
integration with fluid dynamic modeling allows determination of flowmediated transcriptomic alterations
endoluminal biopsy may help facilitate trials of precision medicine approaches to brain arteriovenous malformations in humans
