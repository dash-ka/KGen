Prior regional or single-center studies have noted that 4 percent to 7 percent of eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke decline IV tissue plasminogen activator . We sought to determine the prevalence of tissue plasminogen activator declination in a nationwide registry of patients with acute ischemic stroke  and to investigate differences in declination by race/ethnicity .

We used the Get With The Guidelinesâ€“Stroke registry to identify patients with acute ischemic stroke eligible for tissue plasminogen activator and admitted to participating hospitals between January 1, 2016, and March 28, 2019 . We compared patient demographics and admitting hospital characteristics between tissue plasminogen activator-eligible patients who received and those who declined tissue plasminogen activator . Using multivariable logistic regression, we determined patient and hospital factors associated with tissue plasminogen activator declination .

Among 177,115 tissue plasminogen activator-eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke  at 1,976 sites, 6,545 patients had tissue plasminogen activator declination as the sole documented reason for not receiving tissue plasminogen activator . Patients declining treatment were slightly older, were more likely to be female, arrived more often at off-hours and earlier after symptom onset, and were more likely to present to Primary Stroke Centers . Compared with non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black race and ethnicity was independently associated with increased, Asian race and ethnicity with decreased, and Hispanic ethnicity with similar odds of tissue plasminogen activator declination in multivariable analysis .

Although the overall prevalence of tissue plasminogen activator declination is low, eligible non-Hispanic Black patients are more likely and Asian patients less likely to decline tissue plasminogen activator than non-Hispanic White patients . Reducing rates of tissue plasminogen activator declinations among non-Hispanic Black patients may be an opportunity to address disparities in stroke care .
