we sought to determine the prevalence of tissue plasminogen activator declination in the guidelinesstroke registry to identify patients with acute ischemic stroke eligible for tissue plasminogen activator
we sought to determine the prevalence of tissue plasminogen activator declination in the guidelinesstroke registry to investigate differences in declination by raceethnicity

patient factors associated with tissue plasminogen activator declination
among 177115 tissue plasminogen activatoreligible patients with acute ischemic stroke at 1976 sites 6545 patients had tissue plasminogen activator declination as the sole documented reason for not receiving tissue plasminogen activator
patients were more likely to present to primary stroke centers
patients were slightly older
patients arrived more often at offhours after symptom onset
patients arrived earlier after symptom onset
patients declining treatment
patients were more likely to be female
increased asian race and ethnicity with decreased

compared with nonhispanic white nonhispanic black race and ethnicity was independently associated with hispanic ethnicity with similar odds of tissue plasminogen activator declination in multivariable analysis
although the overall prevalence of tissue plasminogen activator declination is low eligible nonhispanic black patients are asian patients less likely to decline tissue plasminogen activator than nonhispanic white patients
although the overall prevalence of tissue plasminogen activator declination is low eligible nonhispanic black patients are more likely
reducing rates of tissue plasminogen activator declinations among nonhispanic black patients may be an opportunity to address disparities in stroke care
