telestroke networks are facilitate greater access to care particularly in underserved regions
telestroke networks are associated with improved outcomes from acute ischemic stroke
telestroke networks also have the potential to influence patient disposition through avoiding unnecessary interhospital transfers
this study examines the effect of implementation of the va national telestroke program on interhospital transfer among veterans
acute ischemic stroke presenting to the emergency departments of 21 va hospitals before and after telestroke implementation
we analyzed patients with acute ischemic stroke
transfer rates were determined through review of administrative data
chart review and patient were collected to identify predictors of transfer
facilitylevel characteristics were collected to identify predictors of transfer
comparisons were made using kh2 analysis
comparisons were made using wilcoxon rank sum
comparisons were made using t test
multivariable logistic regression with sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the influence of telestroke implementation on transfer rates
we analyzed 3488 stroke encounters
following implementation we observed an absolute 144 percent decrease in transfers across all levels of stroke center designation
younger age were associated with transfer
shorter duration from symptom onset were associated with transfer
higher stroke severity were associated with transfer
at the facility level hospitals with lower annual stroke volume were more likely to transfer
1 hospital saw an increase in transfer rates following implementation
after adjusting for facility characteristics the implementation of va national telestroke program resulted in a nearly 60 percent reduction in odds of transfer
after adjusting for patient characteristics the implementation of va national telestroke program resulted in a nearly 60 percent reduction in odds of transfer
in addition to improving treatment in acute stroke telestroke networks have the potential to positively affect the efficiency of interhospital networks through disposition optimization
in addition to improving treatment in acute stroke telestroke networks have the avoidance of unnecessary transfers
