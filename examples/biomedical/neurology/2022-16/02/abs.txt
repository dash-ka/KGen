Telestroke networks are associated with improved outcomes from acute ischemic stroke and facilitate greater access to care, particularly in underserved regions . These networks also have the potential to influence patient disposition through avoiding unnecessary interhospital transfers . This study examines the effect of implementation of the VA National Telestroke Program on interhospital transfer among Veterans .

We analyzed patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting to the emergency departments of 21 VA hospitals before and after telestroke implementation . Transfer rates were determined through review of administrative data and chart review and patient and facility-level characteristics were collected to identify predictors of transfer . Comparisons were made using t test, Wilcoxon rank sum, and Ï‡2 analysis . Multivariable logistic regression with sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the influence of telestroke implementation on transfer rates .

We analyzed 3,488 stroke encounters . Following implementation, we observed an absolute 14.4 percent decrease in transfers across all levels of stroke center designation . Younger age, higher stroke severity, and shorter duration from symptom onset were associated with transfer . At the facility level, hospitals with lower annual stroke volume were more likely to transfer . 1 hospital saw an increase in transfer rates following implementation . After adjusting for patient and facility characteristics, the implementation of VA National Telestroke Program resulted in a nearly 60 percent reduction in odds of transfer .

In addition to improving treatment in acute stroke, telestroke networks have the potential to positively affect the efficiency of interhospital networks through disposition optimization and the avoidance of unnecessary transfers .
