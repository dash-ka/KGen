patients with pediatriconset multiple sclerosis can be especially vulnerable to cognitive impairment due to the onset of multiple sclerosis during a critical period for cns development and maturation
the objective of this longitudinal study was to assess longterm cognitive functioning in the italian pediatric multiple sclerosis cohort previously assessed at baseline
the objective of this longitudinal study was to assess socioprofessional attainment in the italian pediatric multiple sclerosis cohort previously assessed at baseline
the objective of this longitudinal study was to assess longterm cognitive functioning in the italian pediatric multiple sclerosis cohort previously assessed at 5 years
the objective of this longitudinal study was to assess longterm cognitive functioning in the italian pediatric multiple sclerosis cohort previously assessed at 2 years
the objective of this longitudinal study was to assess socioprofessional attainment in the italian pediatric multiple sclerosis cohort previously assessed at 2 years
the objective of this longitudinal study was to assess socioprofessional attainment in the italian pediatric multiple sclerosis cohort previously assessed at 5 years
the 48 patients were screened for inclusion
the 48 patients evaluated at the 5year assessment
all participants were assessed with a cognitive test battery
a cognitive test battery exploring 4 different cognitive abilities
fatigue were also assessed
depression were also assessed
socioprofessional attainment were also assessed
the whole cohort evolution over time was analyzed with an analysis of variance for repeated measurements test
mean cognitive z scores were calculated for the whole cohort
predictors of cognitive worsening were assessed with a linear mixedmodel analysis
predictors of improvement were assessed with a linear mixedmodel analysis
thirtythree participants were included
the global cognitive performance worsened at year 2
the global cognitive performance improved at year 5 although the z score remained significantly lower than at baseline
there was no significant variation between years 5 and 12
higher iq at baseline predicted better cognitive performances
lower number of relapses in the 2 years before baseline predicted better cognitive performances
eighteen patients failed at least 2 tests compared with healthy controls
eighteen patients were defined as cognitively impaired
the presence of cognitive impairment predicted worse socioprofessional attainment
the longitudinal cognitive trajectory in pediatriconset multiple sclerosis has a heterogeneous course over time with a decline in the first years
the first years followed by a partial recovery over the long term
however at the last followup evaluation the proportion of impaired patients was more than double compared with baseline with a negative impact on the individuals socioprofessional attainment in adulthood
this longitudinal study underscores how cognitive reserve may partially mitigate the negative effects of brain damage
the negative effects of brain damage highlighting the critical importance of intellectual enrichment early during the disease course
