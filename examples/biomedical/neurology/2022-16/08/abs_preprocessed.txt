to investigate relationships of education in individuals with biomarkerdefined alzheimer disease
to investigate intracranial volume with cognitive trajectories and mortality in individuals with biomarkerdefined alzheimer disease
we selected 1298 betaamyloidpositive memory clinic patients with alzheimer disease dementia from the amsterdam dementia cohort
we selected 1298 betaamyloidpositive memory clinic patients with mild cognitive impairment from the amsterdam dementia cohort
we selected 1298 betaamyloidpositive memory clinic patients with subjective cognitive decline from the amsterdam dementia cohort
all participants underwent baseline mri
68 percent received cognitive followup
all participants underwent neuropsychological assessment
mortality data were collected from the central public administration
in the total sample we examined intracranial volume as predictors of baseline to death
in stratified by disease stage we examined intracranial volume as predictors of baseline to death
in the total sample we examined intracranial volume as longitudinal cognitive performance on 5 cognitive domains to death
in the total sample we examined intracranial volume as longitudinal cognitive performance on time to death
in the total sample we examined education volume as longitudinal cognitive performance on 5 cognitive domains to death
in the total sample we examined education volume as predictors of baseline to death
in stratified by disease stage we examined intracranial volume as longitudinal cognitive performance on 5 cognitive domains to death
in stratified by disease stage we examined education volume as longitudinal cognitive performance on time to death
in stratified by disease stage we examined education volume as predictors of baseline to death
in stratified by disease stage we examined education volume as longitudinal cognitive performance on 5 cognitive domains to death
in stratified by disease stage we examined intracranial volume as longitudinal cognitive performance on time to death
in the total sample we examined education volume as longitudinal cognitive performance on time to death
analyses were adjusted for whole brain gray matter atrophy
analyses were adjusted for mri field strength
analyses were adjusted for age
analyses were adjusted for sex
education showed consistent positive associations with baseline cognition across disease stages
intracranial volume showed consistent positive associations with baseline cognition across disease stages
longitudinally we observed a relationship between faster cognitive decline among patients with dementia on executive function
longitudinally we observed a relationship between higher education among patients with dementia on memory
longitudinally we observed a relationship between higher education among patients with dementia on global cognition
longitudinally we observed a relationship between higher education among patients with dementia on language
longitudinally we observed a relationship between faster cognitive decline among patients with dementia on global cognition
longitudinally we observed a relationship between higher education among patients with dementia on executive function
longitudinally we observed a relationship between faster cognitive decline among patients with dementia on language
longitudinally we observed a relationship between faster cognitive decline among patients with dementia on memory
furthermore in the total sample both higher education were related to lower mortality risk
furthermore in the total sample both larger intracranial volume were related to lower mortality risk
in this betaamyloidpositive memory clinic sample both brain reserve were positively associated with baseline cognition whereas only education was related to longitudinal cognition
in this betaamyloidpositive memory clinic sample both cognitive were positively associated with baseline cognition whereas only education was related to longitudinal cognition
higher education both moderately attenuated overall mortality risk in alzheimer disease
intracranial volume both moderately attenuated overall mortality risk in alzheimer disease
