To investigate relationships of education and intracranial volume with cognitive trajectories and mortality in individuals with biomarker-defined Alzheimer disease.

We selected 1,298 Beta-amyloid–positive memory clinic patients with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer disease dementia from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort . All participants underwent baseline MRI and neuropsychological assessment, and 68 percent received cognitive follow-up . Mortality data were collected from the Central Public Administration . In the total sample and stratified by disease stage, we examined education and intracranial volume as predictors of baseline and longitudinal cognitive performance on 5 cognitive domains and time to death . Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, whole brain gray matter atrophy, and MRI field strength .

Education and intracranial volume showed consistent positive associations with baseline cognition across disease stages . Longitudinally, we observed a relationship between higher education and faster cognitive decline among patients with dementia on global cognition, memory, executive function, and language . Furthermore, in the total sample, both higher education and larger intracranial volume were related to lower mortality risk .

In this Beta-amyloid–positive memory clinic sample, both cognitive and brain reserve were positively associated with baseline cognition, whereas only education was related to longitudinal cognition . Higher education and intracranial volume both moderately attenuated overall mortality risk in Alzheimer disease .
