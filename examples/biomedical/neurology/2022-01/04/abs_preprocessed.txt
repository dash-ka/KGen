prrt2 variants have been reported in a few cases of patients with hemiplegic migraine
to clarify the role of prrt2 in familial hemiplegic migraine we studied this gene in a large cohort of affected probands
methods prrt2 was analyzed in 860 probands with hemiplegic migraine
prrt2 variations were identified in 30 probands
genotyping of relatives identified a total of 49 persons with variations whose clinical manifestations were detailed
results prrt2 variations were found in 18 of 697 consecutive probands
163 probands who previously tested negative for scn1a variations
163 probands who previously tested negative for cacna1a
163 probands who previously tested negative for atp1a2
697 consecutive probands screened simultaneously on the 4 genes
results prrt2 variations were found in 12 of 163 probands
in this second group pathogenic variants were found in 105 individuals mostly in atp1a2
atp1a2 followed by scn1a
atp1a2 followed by cacna1a
atp1a2 followed by prrt2
the prrt2 variations included 7 distinct variants
7 distinct variants 5 of which have already been described in persons with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia
7 distinct variants 5 of which have already been described in persons with 2 new variants
eight probands had a deletion of the whole prrt2 gene
hemiplegic migraine associated with another manifestation
among the 49 patients with variations in prrt2 26 had 16 had hemiplegic migraine
among the 49 patients with variations in prrt2 26 had pure hemiplegic migraine had hemiplegic migraine
three patients had epilepsy without migraine
discussion prrt2 should be regarded as the fourth autosomal dominant gene for hemiplegic migraine and screened in any affected patient together with the 3 other main genes
further studies are needed to understand how the same lossoffunction prrt2 variations can lead to a wide range of neurologic phenotypes including paroxysmal movement disorder epilepsy learning sleep disorder
