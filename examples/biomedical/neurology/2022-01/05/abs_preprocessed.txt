95 percent specificity using a unique method of multiple thresholds metaanalysis
this study determines thresholds of serum neuron specific enolase  nse  for prediction of poor outcome after cardiac arrest with over 95 percent specificity
methods data from a systematic review by the european resuscitation council were updated with literature searches from scopus until august 2020
methods data from a systematic review by the european resuscitation council were updated with literature searches from cochrane until august 2020
methods data from a systematic review by the european resuscitation council were updated with literature searches from pubmed until august 2020
comatose cardiac arrest survivors aged over 16 years
16 years undergoing targeted nse levels within 96 hours of resuscitation
cohort studies with comatose cardiac arrest survivors were included
16 years undergoing targeted temperature management within 96 hours of resuscitation
poor outcome was defined as cerebral performance category 3 to 5 at hospital discharge or later
studies without extractable contingency tables were excluded
a multiple thresholds metaanalysis model was used to generate summary receiver operating characteristic curves for various time points
nse thresholds for over 95 percent specificity were calculated
evidence appraisal was performed using a method
a method adapted from the american academy of neurology grading criteria
conclusions nse thresholds for highly specific prediction of poor outcome are much higher
conclusions nse thresholds for highly specific prediction of poor outcome are generally used
future studies must minimize bias by masking treatment teams by prespecifying criteria for withdrawal of life support
future studies must minimize bias by masking treatment teams to the results of potential predictors
