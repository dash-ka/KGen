This study determines thresholds of serum Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE) for prediction of poor outcome after cardiac arrest with over 95 percent specificity using a unique method of multiple thresholds meta-analysis .

Methods Data from a systematic review by the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) were updated with literature searches from PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus until August 2020 . Cohort studies with comatose cardiac arrest survivors aged over 16 years undergoing targeted temperature management (TTM) and NSE levels within 96 hours of resuscitation were included . Poor outcome was defined as cerebral performance category 3 to 5 at hospital discharge or later . Studies without extractable contingency tables were excluded . A multiple thresholds meta-analysis model was used to generate summary receiver operating characteristic curves for various time points . NSE thresholds for over 95 percent specificity were calculated . Evidence appraisal was performed using a method adapted from the American Academy of Neurology grading criteria .

Conclusions NSE thresholds for highly specific prediction of poor outcome are much higher than generally used . Future studies must minimize bias by masking treatment teams to the results of potential predictors and by prespecifying criteria for withdrawal of life support .
