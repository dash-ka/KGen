this study compares the performance of the 2017 revisions to mcdonald criteria with the 2010 mcdonald criteria in predicting prognosis in patients with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of multiple sclerosis
this study compares the performance of the 2017 revisions to mcdonald criteria with the 2010 mcdonald criteria in establishing multiple sclerosis diagnosis
spinal cord mri obtained less than 5 months from clinically isolated syndrome onset and a followup brain mri acquired within 15 months from clinically isolated syndrome onset were evaluated in 785 patients with clinically isolated syndrome from 9 european centers
csf examination and brain obtained less than 5 months from clinically isolated syndrome onset and a followup brain mri acquired within 15 months from clinically isolated syndrome onset were evaluated in 785 patients with clinically isolated syndrome from 9 european centers
date of second clinical attack isolated syndrome onset occurred were also collected
date of reaching expanded disability status scale score greater than 30 if csf examination and brain obtained less than 5 months from clinically isolated syndrome onset and a followup brain mri acquired within 15 months from clinically isolated syndrome onset occurred were also collected
date of reaching expanded disability status scale score greater than 30 if spinal cord mri obtained less than 5 months from clinically isolated syndrome onset and a followup brain mri acquired within 15 months from clinically isolated syndrome onset occurred were also collected
performance of the 2017 for dissemination in dissemination in time  for predicting expanded disability status scale score greater than 30 at followup was evaluated
performance of the 2017 for dissemination in space in time for predicting a second clinical attack greater than 30 at followup was evaluated
performance of the 2017 for dissemination in space in time for predicting expanded disability status scale score greater than 30 at followup was evaluated
performance of 2010 mcdonald criteria for dissemination in space in time  for predicting expanded disability status scale score greater than 30 at followup was evaluated
performance of the 2017 for dissemination in dissemination in time for predicting a second clinical attack greater than 30 at followup was evaluated
performance of 2010 mcdonald criteria for dissemination in space in time for predicting a second clinical attack greater than 30 at followup was evaluated
performance of 2010 mcdonald criteria for dissemination in dissemination in time for predicting expanded disability status scale score greater than 30 at followup was evaluated
performance of 2010 mcdonald criteria for dissemination in dissemination in time for predicting a second clinical attack greater than 30 at followup was evaluated
time to multiple sclerosis diagnosis for the different criteria was also estimated
at followup 406785 patients with clinically isolated syndrome developed cdms
at 36 months the 2017 space plus time criteria had similar area under the curve values
at 36 months the 2017 space plus time criteria had higher sensitivity under the curve values
at 36 months the 2017 space plus time criteria had lower specificity under the curve values
median time to multiple sclerosis diagnosis was shorter with the 2017
median time to multiple sclerosis diagnosis was shorter with the 2010
median time to multiple sclerosis diagnosis was shorter with cdms criteria
the 2 sets of criteria similarly predicted expanded disability status scale score greater than 30 milestone
three periventricular lesions improved specificity in patients older than 45 years
mcdonald criteria showed higher sensitivity in predicting cdms compared to 2010 mcdonald criteria while shortening time to diagnosis of multiple sclerosis
mcdonald criteria showed similar accuracy in predicting cdms compared to 2010 mcdonald criteria while shortening time to diagnosis of multiple sclerosis
mcdonald criteria showed lower specificity in predicting cdms compared to 2010 mcdonald criteria while shortening time to diagnosis of multiple sclerosis
this study provides class ii evidence that the 2017 mcdonald criteria more accurately distinguish cdms in patients early after a clinically isolated syndrome when compared to the 2010 mcdonald criteria mcdonald criteria
