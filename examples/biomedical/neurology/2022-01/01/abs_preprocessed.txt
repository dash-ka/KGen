this communitybased study investigates sustained incident Mild Cognitive Impairment diagnosis classification as progression to dementia
this communitybased study investigates sociodemographic predictors
this communitybased study investigates sustained Mild Cognitive Impairment  diagnosis classification as cognitively normal
this communitybased study investigates medical predictors
within a communitybased cohort diagnoses of Mild Cognitive Impairment  were made with a published algorithm
diagnosis of dementia was based on clinical consensus
cox regressions estimated hazard ratios of Mild Cognitive Impairment 
Mild Cognitive Impairment  associated with several predictors
relative risks associated with predictors of diagnostic status at followup after incidence
modified poisson regressions estimated relative risks
among 2903 cognitively normal participants at baseline 752 developed Mild Cognitive Impairment  over an average of 63 years
presence of higher medical burden increased risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment  while more years of more leisure activities decreased this risk
presence of apoe epsilon4 increased risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment  while more years of more leisure activities decreased this risk
presence of higher medical burden increased risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment  while more years of higher income decreased this risk
presence of apoe epsilon4 increased risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment  while more years of education decreased this risk
presence of apoe epsilon4 increased risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment  while more years of higher income decreased this risk
presence of higher medical burden increased risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment  while more years of education decreased this risk
of the incident Mild Cognitive Impairment  cases after an average of 24 years of followup 129 percent progressed to dementia 96 percent declined in functioning and did not meet the algorithmic criteria for Mild Cognitive Impairment  296 percent continued to meet Mild Cognitive Impairment  criteria and 479 percent no longer met Mild Cognitive Impairment  criteria
of the incident Mild Cognitive Impairment  cases after an average of 24 years of followup 129 percent progressed to dementia 96 percent did not meet the clinical criteria for dementia 296 percent continued to meet Mild Cognitive Impairment  criteria and 479 percent no longer met Mild Cognitive Impairment  criteria
multidomain Mild Cognitive Impairment  presence of apoe epsilon4 increased the risk of progression to dementia
multidomain Mild Cognitive Impairment  presence of depressive symptoms increased the risk of progression to dementia
multidomain Mild Cognitive Impairment  presence of antidepressant use increased the risk of progression to dementia
this communitybased study showed that almost half of the individuals with incident Mild Cognitive Impairment  diagnoses were classified as cognitively normal at followup
predictors of Mild Cognitive Impairment  demonstrably differed from those of subsequent Mild Cognitive Impairment  course
this communitybased study can refine expectations for functional course of those of subsequent Mild Cognitive Impairment  course  
this communitybased study can refine expectations for cognitive course of those of subsequent Mild Cognitive Impairment  course
