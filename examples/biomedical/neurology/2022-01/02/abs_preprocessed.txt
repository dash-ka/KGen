late neuropathologies of repetitive head impacts from contact sports can include white matter degeneration
late neuropathologies of repetitive head impacts from contact sports can include chronic traumatic encephalopathy
white matter hyperintensities on fluidattenuated inversion recovery mri scans are often viewed as microvascular disease from vascular risk
white matter hyperintensities on fluidattenuated inversion recovery mri scans might have unique underlying pathologies
white matter hyperintensities on fluidattenuated inversion recovery mri scans might have risk factors in the setting of repetitive head impacts
we investigated the neuropathologic correlates of antemortem white matter hyperintensities in brain donors
brain donors exposed to repetitive head impacts
the association between white matter hyperintensities were tested
the association between repetitive head impact exposure were tested
the association between informantreported cognitive function were tested
the association between informantreported daily function were tested
this imagingpathologic correlation study included symptomatic male decedents
symptomatic male decedents exposed to repetitive head impacts
donors were without evidence of hemorrhage
donors were without evidence of cns neoplasm
donors were without evidence of large vessel infarcts
donors had antemortem fluidattenuated inversion recovery scans from medical records
donors were without evidence of encephalomalacia
total lesion volume calculated using the lesion prediction algorithm from the lesion segmentation toolbox
white matter hyperintensities were quantified using logtransformed values for total lesion volume
neuropathologic assessments included semiquantitative ratings of cerebrovascular disease
neuropathologic assessments included semiquantitative ratings of hyperphosphorylatedtau
neuropathologic assessments included semiquantitative ratings of betaamyloid
neuropathologic assessments included semiquantitative ratings of white matter rarefaction
among football players years of play was a proxy for repetitive head impact exposure
retrospective informantreported cognitive function were assessed using the cognitive difficulties scale
retrospective informantreported daily function were assessed using the cognitive difficulties scale
retrospective informantreported cognitive function were assessed using functional activities questionnaire
retrospective informantreported daily function were assessed using functional activities questionnaire
this imagingpathologic correlation study included military veterans
this imagingpathologic correlation study included 75 donors
this imagingpathologic correlation study included 67 football players
this imagingpathologic correlation study included 8 nonfootball contact sport athletes
dementia was the most common mri indication
white matter hyperintensities might capture longterm white matter pathologies from repetitive head impacts including those from white matter rarefaction and hyperphosphorylatedtau
white matter hyperintensities might capture longterm white matter pathologies from repetitive head impacts including microvascular disease
prospective imagingpathologic correlation studies are needed
this imagingpathologic correlation study provides class iv evidence of associations between fluidattenuated inversion recovery white matter hyperintensities
symptomatic brain donors exposed to repetitive head impacts
this imagingpathologic correlation study provides class iv evidence of associations between neuropathologic changes years of american football play
this imagingpathologic correlation study reported cognitive symptoms in symptomatic brain donors
