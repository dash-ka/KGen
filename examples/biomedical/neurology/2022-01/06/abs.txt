Nonmotor symptoms are common in patients with Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) . There is limited knowledge regarding fatigue in MSA . This study aimed to investigate the frequency and evolution of fatigue and the factors related to fatigue and its progression in patients with MSA at an early stage .

Patients with probable MSA were comprehensively evaluated at both baseline and the 1-year follow-up, including their motor and nonmotor symptoms . Fatigue and anxiety were assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) , respectively . Orthostatic hypotension (OH) was defined as a decrease in the systolic or diastolic blood pressure by at least 30 and 15 mmHg, respectively . The binary logistic regression model and linear regression model were used to analyze the factors related to fatigue and its progression, respectively .

This study enrolled 146 patients with MSA . The frequency of fatigue was 60.3 percent, 55.1 percent, and 64.9 percent in MSA , MSA with predominant parkinsonism , and MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia , respectively. The frequency of fatigue and the FSS score in patients with MSA increased from baseline to the 1-year follow-up . Young age , OH , and high HARS score  were associated with fatigue in MSA . Neurofilament light chain, alpha-synuclein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell-2 were not significantly associated with fatigue and its progression in MSA .

Discussion Fatigue was prevalent in early-stage MSA, and it increased and remained persistent over time . This study demonstrated that OH and anxiety were associated with fatigue in patients with MSA .
