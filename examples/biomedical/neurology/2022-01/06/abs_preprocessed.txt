nonmotor symptoms are common in patients with multiple system atrophy
there is limited knowledge regarding fatigue in multiple system atrophy
the factors related to fatigue
this study the factors progression in patients with multiple system atrophy at an early stage
this study aimed to investigate the frequency and evolution of fatigue
this study aimed to investigate the factors
the factors related to this study
this study aimed to investigate the frequency and evolution of fatigue
patients with probable multiple system atrophy were comprehensively evaluated at the 1year followup including patients with probable multiple system atrophy motor
patients with probable multiple system atrophy were comprehensively evaluated at both baseline including patients with probable multiple system atrophy motor
patients with probable multiple system atrophy were comprehensively evaluated at both baseline including patients with nonmotor symptoms
patients with probable multiple system atrophy were comprehensively evaluated at the 1year followup including patients with nonmotor symptoms
anxiety were assessed using hamilton anxiety rating scale respectively
fatigue were assessed using hamilton anxiety rating scale respectively
anxiety were assessed using the fatigue severity scale respectively
fatigue were assessed using the fatigue severity scale respectively
orthostatic hypotension was defined as a decrease in the diastolic blood pressure by at least 30
orthostatic hypotension was defined as a decrease in 15 mmhg respectively
orthostatic hypotension was defined as a decrease in the systolic blood pressure by at least 30

this study enrolled 146 patients with multiple system atrophy
the frequency of fatigue was 603 percent respectively
the frequency of fatigue was multiple system atrophy with predominant cerebellar ataxia respectively
the frequency of fatigue was and 649 percent in multiple system atrophy respectively
the frequency of fatigue was 551 percent respectively
the frequency of fatigue was multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism respectively
the the fatigue severity scale score in patients with multiple system atrophy increased from baseline to the 1year followup
the frequency of fatigue increased from baseline to the 1year followup
