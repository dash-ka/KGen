we also performed 18ffluorodeoxyglucosepet in all participants because regional cerebral glucose consumption is thought to largely reflect synaptic activity
volumes of interest were delineated on the basis of individual 3dimensional t1 mri
standardized uptake value ratio1 images were calculated for 11cucbj with the centrum semiovale as reference region
18ffluorodeoxyglucosepet activity was normalized to the pons
all pet data were corrected for partial volume effects
volume of interest were performed
volume of voxelbased analyses were performed
correlations between 11cucbj pet data were calculated
correlations between clinical scores were calculated
eighteen huntington disease mutation carriers were included
in the total huntington disease group significant loss of svsynaptic vesicle protein 2a binding was found in putamen whereas reduced 18ffluorodeoxyglucose uptake was restricted to caudate

in the total huntington disease group significant loss of svsynaptic vesicle protein 2a binding was found in cerebellum whereas reduced 18ffluorodeoxyglucose uptake was restricted to caudate
in the premanifest subgroup 11cucbj showed significant reductions in caudate only
in the premanifest subgroup 18ffluorodeoxyglucosepet showed significant reductions in putamen only

in the total huntington disease group synaptic vesicle protein 2a loss in putamen correlated with motor impairment
in the total huntington disease group synaptic vesicle protein 2a loss in caudate correlated with motor impairment
all pet data reveal loss of presynaptic terminal integrity in early huntington disease spreads extensively to extrastriatal regions in the early manifest phase
all pet data reveal loss of presynaptic terminal integrity in early huntington disease correlates with motor impairment
early huntington disease which begins in the striatum in the premanifest phase
11cucbj pet is more sensitive than 18ffluorodeoxyglucosepet for detection of extrastriatal changes in early huntington disease
a pet imaging study provides class iii evidence that 11cucbj pet accurately discriminates individuals huntington disease from normal controls
