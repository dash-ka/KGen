This study reports final, 36-month safety and clinical outcomes from the PD-1101 trial of NBIb-1817 in participants with moderately advanced Parkinson Disease (PD) and motor fluctuations .

Methods PD-1101 was a phase 1b, open-label, dose escalation trial of VY-AADC01, an experimental AAV2 gene therapy encoding the human aromatic L-aminoacid decarboxylase enzyme . VY-AADC01 was delivered via bilateral, intraoperative MRI-guided putaminal infusions to 3 cohorts .

Results No serious adverse events attributed to VY-AADC01 were reported . All 4 non-vectorâ€“related serious adverse events resolved . Requirements for PD medications were reduced by 21 percent to 30 percent in the 2 highest dose cohorts at 36 months . Standard measures of motor function, global impressions of improvement, and quality of life were stable or improved compared with baseline at 12, 24, and 36 months following VY-AADC01 administration across cohorts .

Discussions VY-AADC01 and the surgical administration procedure were well-tolerated and resulted in stable or improved motor function and quality of life across cohorts, as well as reduced PD medication requirements in cohorts 2 and 3 over 3 years .

This study provides Class IV evidence that, in patients with moderately advanced PD and motor fluctuations, putaminal infusion of VY-AADC01 is well tolerated and may improve motor function .
