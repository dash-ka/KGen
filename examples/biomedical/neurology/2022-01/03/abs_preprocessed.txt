this study reports clinical outcomes from the pd1101 trial of nbib1817 in participants with moderately advanced parkinson disease
methods pd1101 was a phase 1b openlabel dose escalation trial of an experimental aav2 gene therapy
methods pd1101 was a phase 1b openlabel dose escalation trial of vyaadc01
an experimental aav2 gene therapy encoding the human aromatic laminoacid decarboxylase enzyme
vyaadc01 was delivered via bilateral intraoperative mriguided putaminal infusions to 3 cohorts
results no serious adverse events attributed to vyaadc01
results no serious adverse events were reported
all 4 nonvectorrelated serious adverse events resolved
requirements for participants with moderately advanced parkinson disease medications were reduced by 21 percent to 30 percent in the 2 highest dose cohorts at 36 months
standard measures of motor function were improved compared with baseline at 12
global impressions of improvement were improved compared with baseline at 12
quality of life were improved compared with baseline at 36 months following vyaadc01 administration across cohorts
quality of life were improved compared with baseline at 24 months following vyaadc01 administration across cohorts
