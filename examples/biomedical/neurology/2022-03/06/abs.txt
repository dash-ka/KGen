To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive update of the descriptive epidemiology and trends of ischemic stroke has been released since Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 . Thus, our objective was to examine ischemic stroke burden at the global, regional, and national levels in terms of sex, age, and Social Development Index (SDI) .

Data were extracted from the GBD 2019 datasets . Estimated annual percentage changes were calculated to assess the incidence rate, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years trends of ischemic stroke . Measures were stratified by sex, region, country, age, and SDI .
