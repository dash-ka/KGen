This study aims to determine the contributions of sun exposure and Ultra Violet Radiation (UVR) exposure to risk of pediatric-onset Multiple Sclerosis (MS) .

Children with MS and controls recruited from multiple centers in the United States were matched on sex and age . Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to investigate the association of time spent outdoors daily in summer, use of sun protection, and ambient summer UVR dose in the year before birth and the year before diagnosis with MS risk, with adjustment for sex, age, race, birth season, child's skin color, mother's education, tobacco smoke exposure, being overweight, and Epstein-Barr virus infection .

Three hundred thirty-two children with MS and 534 controls were included after matching on sex and age . In a fully adjusted model, compared to spending over 30 minutes outdoors daily during the most recent summer, greater time spent outdoors was associated with a marked reduction in the odds of developing MS, with evidence of dose-response .

If this is a causal association, spending more time in the sun during summer may be strongly protective against developing pediatric MS, as well as residing in a sunnier location .
