three hundred thirtytwo children with pediatriconset multiple sclerosis were included after matching on age
three hundred thirtytwo children with 534 controls were included after matching on age
three hundred thirtytwo children with pediatriconset multiple sclerosis were included after matching on sex
three hundred thirtytwo children with 534 controls were included after matching on sex
in a fully adjusted model compared to spending over 30 minutes outdoors daily during the most recent summer greater time spent outdoors was associated with a marked reduction in the odds of developing pediatriconset multiple sclerosis with evidence of doseresponse
if this is a causal association spending more time in the sun during summer may be strongly protective against residing in a sunnier location
if this is a causal association spending more time in the sun during summer may be strongly protective against developing pediatric pediatriconset multiple sclerosis
