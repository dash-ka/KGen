In patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), disorders of consciousness (DoC) have emerged as a serious complication . The prognosis and pathophysiology of COVID-DoC remain unclear, complicating decisions about continuing life-sustaining treatment. We describe the natural history of COVID-DoC and investigate its associated brain connectivity profile.

In a prospective longitudinal study, we screened consecutive patients with COVID-19 at our institution . We enrolled critically ill adult patients with a DoC unexplained by sedation or structural brain injury and who were planned to undergo a brain MRI . We performed resting-state fMRI and diffusion MRI to evaluate functional and structural connectivity compared to healthy controls and patients with DoC resulting from severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) . We assessed the recovery of consciousness and functional outcomes at hospital discharge and 3 and 6 months after discharge . We also explored whether clinical variables were associated with recovery from COVID-DoC .



Patients who survived invariably recovered consciousness after COVID-DoC . Although disability was common after hospitalization, functional status improved over the ensuing months . While future research is necessary, these prospective findings inform the prognosis and pathophysiology of COVID-DoC .
