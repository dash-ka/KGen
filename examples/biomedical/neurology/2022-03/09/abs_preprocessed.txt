in patients with severe covid19 disorders of consciousness have emerged as a serious complication
the prognosis and pathophysiology of covid19 disorders of consciousness  remain unclear complicating decisions about continuing lifesustaining treatment
covid19 disorders of consciousness  associated brain connectivity profile
we describe the natural history of covid19 disorders of consciousness 
we investigate the natural history of covid19 disorders of consciousness 
in a prospective longitudinal study we screened consecutive patients with covid19 at we institution
we enrolled critically ill adult patients with a disorders of consciousness unexplained by sedation brain injury
we enrolled critically ill adult patients with who were planned to undergo a brain mri
we enrolled critically ill adult patients with a disorders of consciousness unexplained by structural brain injury
we performed restingstate fmri and diffusion a brain mri to evaluate structural connectivity compared to healthy controls and patients with disorders of consciousness
we performed restingstate fmri and diffusion a brain mri to evaluate functional connectivity compared to healthy controls and patients with disorders of consciousness
consciousness resulting from severe traumatic brain injury
we assessed the recovery of consciousness outcomes at hospital discharge 
we assessed the recovery of functional outcomes at 6 months after discharge
we assessed the recovery of consciousness outcomes at 6 months after discharge
we assessed the recovery of consciousness outcomes at 3 months after discharge
we assessed the recovery of functional outcomes at 3 months after discharge
we assessed the recovery of functional outcomes at hospital discharge 
we also explored whether clinical variables were associated with recovery from covid19 disorders of consciousness 
patients invariably recovered consciousness after covid19 disorders of consciousness 
patients who survived
although disability was common after hospitalization functional status improved over the ensuing months
while future research is necessary these prospective findings inform the prognosis and pathophysiology of covid19 disorders of consciousness
