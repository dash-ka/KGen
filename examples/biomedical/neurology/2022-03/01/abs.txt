To identify predictors of postoperative intelligence and developmental quotients and develop and validate clinically applicable intelligence and developmental quotients prediction models .

We retrospectively analyzed neuropsychological outcomes and their possible determinants for children treated in Bethel and Utrecht since 1990. We performed separate analyses for patients with intelligence quotient sand those with only  developmental quotient available. We developed prediction models based on presurgical determinants to predict dichotomized levels of performance .

intelligence and developmental quotients data before and 2 years after surgery were available for 492 patients . 

After epilepsy surgery in children, the risk of cognitive deterioration is very low . Presurgical development has a strong effect on the postoperative trajectory . The presented models can improve presurgical counseling of patients and parents by reliably predicting cognitive outcomes .

This study provides Class II evidence that for children undergoing epilepsy surgery presurgical intelligence and developmental quotients was the strongest predictor of postoperative cognition .
