we retrospectively analyzed neuropsychological outcomes possible determinants for children
children treated in bethel since 1990
we retrospectively analyzed neuropsychological outcomes for children
children treated in utrecht since 1990
we performed separate analyses for patients with intelligence quotient sand those with only developmental quotient available
we developed prediction models
prediction models based on presurgical determinants to predict dichotomized levels of performance
developmental quotients data before and 2 years after surgery were available for 492 patients
intelligence quotients data before and 2 years after surgery were available for 492 patients
after epilepsy surgery in children the risk of cognitive deterioration is very low
presurgical development has a strong effect on the postoperative trajectory
the presented models can improve presurgical counseling of parents by reliably predicting cognitive outcomes
the presented models can improve presurgical counseling of patients by reliably predicting cognitive outcomes
this study provides class ii evidence that for children presurgical intelligence was the strongest predictor of postoperative cognition
children undergoing epilepsy surgery
this study provides class ii evidence that for children developmental quotients was the strongest predictor of postoperative cognition
