Task fMRI is a clinical tool for language lateralization, but has limitations, and cannot provide information about network-level plasticity . Additional methods are needed to improve the precision of presurgical language mapping . We investigate language resting-state functional connectivity in typically developing children and children with epilepsy . Our objectives were to understand how Functional Connectivity components differ between typically developing children and those with epilepsy, elucidate how the location of disease affects Functional Connectivity,  and investigate the relationship between age and Functional Connectivity .

Our sample included 55 TD children and 31 patients with focal epilepsy . All participants underwent RS fMRI . Using a bilateral canonical language map as target, vertex-wise intrahemisphericFunctional Connectivitymap and interhemispheric Functional Connectivity map for each participant were computed and thresholded at top 10 percent to compute anFunctional Connectivitylaterality index of the frontal and temporal regions for both integration and segregation maps .


These findings lend preliminary evidence that Functional Connectivity reflects network plasticity in the form of adaptation and compensation, or the ability to recruit support and reallocate resources within and outside of the traditional network to compensate for disease. Functional Connectivity expands on task-based fMRI and provides complementary and potentially useful information about the language network that is not captured using task-based fMRI alone.
