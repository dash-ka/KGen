to explore the clinical outcomes of patients with acute ischemic stroke  patients with large vessel occlusion
to explore the association between blood pressure  levels after endovascular thrombectomy with large vessel occlusion
a study was eligible if a study enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke  18 years of age with an large vessel occlusion mean 24hour systolic blood pressure values after the end of the endovascular thrombectomy procedure
a study was eligible if a study enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke  18 years of age with an large vessel occlusion treated with either unsuccessful endovascular thrombectomy
a study was eligible if a study enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke  18 years of age with an large vessel occlusion provided either individual
a study was eligible if a study enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke  18 years of age with an large vessel occlusion treated with either successful endovascular thrombectomy
individual patient data from all studies were analyzed with a generalized linear mixedeffects model
increased mean systolic blood pressure levels in the first 24 hours after endovascular thrombectomy are independently associated with a higher odds of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage
increased mean systolic blood pressure levels in the first 24 hours after endovascular thrombectomy are independently associated with a higher odds of early neurologic deterioration
increased mean systolic blood pressure levels in the first 24 hours after endovascular thrombectomy are independently associated with a higher odds of worse 3month functional outcomes
increased mean systolic blood pressure levels in the first 24 hours after endovascular thrombectomy are independently associated with a higher odds of 3month mortality
