To explore the association between Blood Pressure (BP) levels after Endovascular Thrombectomy (EVT) and the clinical outcomes of patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) patients with Large Vessel Occlusion (LVO) .

A study was eligible if it enrolled patients with AIS >18 years of age with an LVO treated with either successful or unsuccessful EVT and provided either individual or mean 24-hour systolic BP values after the end of the EVT procedure. Individual patient data from all studies were analyzed with a generalized linear mixed-effects model.



Increased mean systolic BP levels in the first 24 hours after EVT are independently associated with a higher odds of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, early neurologic deterioration, 3-month mortality, and worse 3-month functional outcomes .
