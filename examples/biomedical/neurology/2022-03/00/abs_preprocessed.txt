mortality is increased in epilepsy
the important issue is that a proportion of epilepsyrelated death is potentially preventable by optimized therapy
the important issue is that a proportion of epilepsyrelated death needs to be identified
a new systematic classification of epilepsyrelated mortality has been suggested to identify these preventable deaths
we applied a new systematic classification of epilepsyrelated mortality to an analysis of premature mortality in persons with epilepsy
epilepsy who were younger than 50 years of age
the study was a populationbased retrospective cohort of all danish citizens with and without epilepsy 1 to 49 years of age during 2007 to 2009
information on these preventable deaths was retrieved from the danish because of death registry
information on these preventable deaths was retrieved from the danish because of autopsy reports
information on these preventable deaths was retrieved from the danish because of the danish national patient registry
information on these preventable deaths was retrieved from the danish because of death certificates
the primary because of death in persons with epilepsy was evaluated independently by 2 cardiologists
the primary because of death in persons with epilepsy was evaluated independently by 1 neuropediatrician
the primary because of death in persons with epilepsy was evaluated independently by 3 neurologist
in case of uncertainty a pathologist was consulted
these preventable deaths were classified as either epilepsy not epilepsy related
these preventable deaths were classified as either epilepsy related
modes of death were compared between persons with and without epilepsy
the underlying causes were compared between persons with and without epilepsy
440 of 700 deaths were epilepsy related 169 directly related to 181 due to an underlying neurologic disease
440 of 700 deaths were epilepsy related 169 directly related to seizures due to an underlying neurologic disease
during the study period
700 deaths were identified in persons with epilepsy
sudden unexpected death in epilepsy accounted for 80 percent of deaths directly related to epilepsy
aspiration pneumonia was the because of death in 80 percent of cases indirectly related to epilepsy
compared with the background population persons with epilepsy had a nearly 4fold increased alcoholrelated conditions
compared with the background population persons with epilepsy had a nearly 4fold increased suicide
compared with the background population persons with epilepsy had a nearly 4fold increased allbecause mortality
the newly proposed classification for mortality in persons with epilepsy was useful in an unselected nationwide cohort
the newly proposed classification for mortality in persons with epilepsy helped in classifying unnatural causes of death as epilepsy related or not
the newly proposed classification for mortality in persons with epilepsy helped in identifying potentially preventable deaths
the leading causes of premature mortality in persons younger than 50 years of age were thus potentially preventable by good seizure control
the leading causes of premature mortality in persons younger than 50 years of age were related to epilepsy
