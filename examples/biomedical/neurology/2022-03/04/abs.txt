To understand patterns of care and circumstances surrounding end of life in patients with intracranial gliomas.

We retrospectively analyzed end-of-life circumstances in patients with intracranial high-grade gliomas at Columbia University Irving Medical Center who died from January 2014 to February 2019, including cause of death, location of death, and implementation of comfort measures and resuscitative efforts .


Clinical tumor progression was the most common cause of death, followed by infection . Hospice or comfort measures were ultimately implemented in 94.7 percent of patients, although resuscitation was performed in 13.2 percent . Improved understanding of circumstances surrounding death, frequency of use of hospice services, and frequency of resuscitative efforts in patients with gliomas may allow physicians to more accurately discuss end-of-life expectations with patients and caregivers, facilitating informed care planning .
