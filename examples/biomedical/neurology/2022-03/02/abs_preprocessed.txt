focal cortical dysplasia has been associated with poorer postsurgical seizure outcomes compared to other pathologies
focal cortical dysplasia surgical series have been assembled on patients with abnormal and normal preoperative mri
focal cortical dysplasia surgical series have been assembled on the basis 
however in clinical workflow patient selection for surgery is based on preoperative findings including mri
we performed a systematic review and metaanalysis of the literature to determine the rate and predictors of favorable seizure outcome after surgery for mridetected focal cortical dysplasia
we devised we study protocol in accordance with preferred reporting items for systematic reviews
we registered the protocol with prospero
we devised we study protocol in accordance with preferred reporting items for metaanalyses guidelines
we searched embase of science for studies of patients followed up for over 12 months after resective surgery for drugresistant epilepsy with mridetected focal cortical dysplasia
we searched web of science for studies of patients followed up for over 12 months after resective surgery for drugresistant epilepsy with mridetected focal cortical dysplasia
we searched medline of science for studies of patients followed up for over 12 months after resective surgery for drugresistant epilepsy with mridetected focal cortical dysplasia
patients attaining a favorable outcome
randomeffects metaanalysis was used to calculate the proportion of patients
a favorable outcome defined as seizurefree status
a favorable outcome defined as international league against epilepsy class 1 to 2
a favorable outcome defined as engel class i
metaregression was performed to investigate sources of heterogeneity
seventy percent of mri features of focal cortical dysplasia attain a favorable seizure outcome after resective surgery
seventy percent of patients with drugresistant epilepsy attain a favorable seizure outcome after resective surgery
we findings can be incorporated into routine preoperative counseling
we findings can reinforce the importance of completely resecting the mridetected focal cortical dysplasia when feasible
we findings can reinforce the importance of completely resecting the mridetected focal cortical dysplasia when safe
