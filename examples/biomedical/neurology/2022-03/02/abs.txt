Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) has been associated with poorer postsurgical seizure outcomes compared to other pathologies . FCD surgical series have been assembled on the basis of a histologic diagnosis, including patients with abnormal and normal preoperative MRI . However, in clinical workflow, patient selection for surgery is based on preoperative findings, including MRI . We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to determine the rate and predictors of favorable seizure outcome after surgery for MRI-detected FCD .

We devised our study protocol in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered the protocol with PROSPERO . We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science for studies of patients followed up for over 12 months after resective surgery for drug-resistant epilepsy with MRI-detected FCD . Random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate the proportion of patients attaining a favorable outcome, defined as Engel class I, International League Against Epilepsy class 1 to 2, or seizure-free status . Meta-regression was performed to investigate sources of heterogeneity .



Seventy percent of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and MRI features of FCD attain a favorable seizure outcome after resective surgery . Our findings can be incorporated into routine preoperative counseling and reinforce the importance of completely resecting the MRI-detected FCD when safe and feasible .
