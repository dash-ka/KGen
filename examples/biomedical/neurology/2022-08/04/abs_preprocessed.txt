the aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with subjective initial memory complaints also show objective very longterm memory deficit with accelerated longterm

longterm forgetting
we tested patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with 2 surprise memory tests after 3 weeks
the standard free and cued selective reminding a new test specifically designed to capture more ecologic aspects of autobiographical memory
the standard free and cued selective reminding epireal specifically designed to capture more ecologic aspects of autobiographical memory

temporal lobe epilepsy who complained about fortyseven memory
temporal lobe epilepsy who complained for whom the standard neuropsychological assessment did not reveal any memory impairment after a standard delay of 20 minutes
fortyseven patients with temporal lobe epilepsy underwent 2 surprise memory tests after 3 weeks
fortyseven were compared to 35 healthy controls
after 3 weeks free selective reminding epireal recall scores were significantly lower in patients than in controls
after 3 weeks cued selective reminding test recall scores were significantly lower in patients than in controls
after 3 weeks cued selective reminding epireal recall scores were significantly lower in patients than in controls
after 3 weeks free selective reminding test recall scores were significantly lower in patients than in controls
there was no significant correlation between cued selective reminding epireal scores
there was no significant correlation between cued selective reminding test scores
there was no significant correlation between free selective reminding epireal scores
there was no significant correlation between free selective reminding test scores
seventysix percent of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy had objective impairment on at least 1 of these very longterm memory tests regardless of the existence and type of response to antiseizure medication
seventysix percent of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy had objective impairment on at least 1 of these very longterm memory tests regardless of the existence and type of lesion to antiseizure medication
easily applicable epireal had a higher effect size
easily applicable epireal is a useful addition to the standard workup
easily applicable epireal detected deficits in 28 percent more patients
assessing longterm memory should be broadened to a wide spectrum of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with a memory complaint regardless of the epileptic syndrome regardless of whether the epileptic syndrome is associated with a lesion
this could lead to rethinking temporal lobe epilepsy nosology
temporal lobe epilepsy nosology associated with memory
