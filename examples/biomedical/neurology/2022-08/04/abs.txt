The aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with subjective initial memory complaints and various phenotypes also show objective very long-term memory deficit with accelerated long-term forgetting . We tested patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with 2 surprise memory tests after 3 weeks. the standard Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test and Epireal, a new test specifically designed to capture more ecologic aspects of autobiographical memory.

Forty-seven patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who complained about their memory, but for whom the standard neuropsychological assessment did not reveal any memory impairment after a standard delay of 20 minutes, underwent 2 surprise memory tests after 3 weeks . They were compared to 35 healthy controls .

After 3 weeks,  Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test and Epireal recall scores were significantly lower in patients than in controls . There was no significant correlation between  Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test and Epireal scores . Seventy-six percent of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy had objective impairment on at least 1 of these very long-term memory tests, regardless of the existence and type of lesion or response to antiseizure medication . Easily applicable, Epireal had a higher effect size, detected deficits in 28 percent more patients, and is a useful addition to the standard workup.

Assessing long-term memory should be broadened to a wide spectrum of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with a memory complaint, regardless of the epileptic syndrome, regardless of whether it is associated with a lesion . This could lead to rethinking temporal lobe epilepsy nosology associated with memory .
