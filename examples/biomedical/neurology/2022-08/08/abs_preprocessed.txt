two hundred thirtyseven patients with early parkinson disease were included
moderate to vigorous exerconfidence intervalse levels at baseline did not significantly affect the subsequent clinical progression of the parkinsons
regular physical activity did not significantly affect the subsequent clinical progression of the parkinsons
assoconfidence intervalated with slower deterioration of postural stability activities of daily living
however average regular overall physical activity levels over time were significantly processing speed in patients with the parkinsons
assoconfidence intervalated with slower deterioration of gait stability activities of daily living
however average regular overall physical activity levels over time were significantly assoconfidence
assoconfidence intervalated with slower deterioration of processing speed
workrelated activity levels were primarily assoconfidence
moderate to vigorous exerconfidence intervalse levels were preferentially assoconfidence
assoconfidence intervalated with slower decline of gait stability
assoconfidence intervalated with slower decline of postural
propensity score matching confirmed the robustness of our results
multiple imputation score matching confirmed the robustness of our results
assoconfidence intervalated with better clinical course of the parkinsons
in the long term the maintenance of high regular physical activity levels was robustly assoconfidence with each type of physical activity
in the long term the maintenance of exerconfidence intervalse habits was robustly assoconfidence with each type of physical activity
physical activity having different effects
assoconfidence intervalated with slower decline of several clinical
this study provides class ii evidence that sustained increase in overall regular physical activity levels in patients with early parkinson disease was assoconfidence
