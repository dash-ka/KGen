the glymphatic system is a fluidtransport pathway
a fluidtransport pathway that clears cerebral waste products
the glymphatic system which is robustly enabled during some stages of sleep
most contemporary knowledge regarding the glymphatic system is inferred from rodent experiments
human research is limited
our objective is to explore the associations between human glymphatic function
our objective is to explore the associations between cerebral gray matter volumes
our objective is to explore the associations between sleep
our objective is to explore the associations between neuropsychological performance
this crosssectional study included older
older who had participated in the integrating systemic data of geriatric medicine to explore the solution for health aging study between october 2020
this crosssectional study included individuals 60 years
older who had participated in the integrating systemic data of geriatric medicine to explore the solution for health aging study between september 2019
communitydwelling older adults were enrolled at 2 different sites
participants with other major organ system abnormalities were excluded
participants with major depressive disorders were excluded
participants with dementia were excluded
sleep profile was accessed using questionnaires
sleep profile was accessed using polysomnography
administered neuropsychological test batteries included everyday cognition to establish a registry for alzheimers disease neuropsychological battery
administered neuropsychological test batteries included the consortium to establish a registry for alzheimers disease neuropsychological battery
gray matter volumes were estimated based on mri
diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space index was used as the mri marker of glymphatic function
a total of 84 participants were analyzed
multivariate linear regression model determined that n2 sleep duration were independently associated with diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space
multivariate linear regression model determined that age were independently associated with diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space
multivariate linear regression model determined that the perivascular space index were independently associated with diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space
neuropsychological battery word list learning delayed recall subtest scores after covarying for age
higher diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space was associated with better everyday cognition language scores to establish a registry for alzheimers disease neuropsychological battery word list
neuropsychological battery word list learning delayed recall subtest scores after covarying for education
higher diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space was associated with better everyday cognition the consortium to establish a registry for alzheimers disease neuropsychological battery word list
higher diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space was also associated with higher gray matter volume after controlling for total intracranial volume
higher diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space was also associated with higher gray matter volume after controlling for age
higher diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space was also associated with higher gray matter volume after controlling for sex
significant associations were identified between glymphatic function and sleep stressing the importance of sleep for brain health
this crosssectional study also revealed associations between diffusion tensor imaging analysis along cerebral gray matter volumes suggesting the potential of diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space as a biomarker for cognitive disorders
