functional nearinfrared spectroscopy studies provide direct evidence of the important role of the prefrontal cortex during walking in parkinson disease
most studies explored mean hemoglobin levels while momenttomoment variability measures have rarely been investigated
flexibility which is imperative for adaptive function
variability measures can inform on flexibility
we hypothesized that patients with aging disease will show less variability in hemoglobin signals during walking compared to healthy controls
we hypothesized that patients with parkinson disease will show less variability in hemoglobin signals during walking compared to healthy controls
149 patients with idiopathic parkinson disease performed usual walking with an functional nearinfrared spectroscopy sensor
57 healthy controls performed usual walking with an functional nearinfrared spectroscopy sensor
57 healthy controls performed dualtask walking with an functional nearinfrared spectroscopy sensor
an functional nearinfrared spectroscopy sensor placed on the forehead
two hundred six participants performed usual walking with an functional nearinfrared spectroscopy sensor
149 patients with idiopathic parkinson disease performed dualtask walking with an functional nearinfrared spectroscopy sensor
two hundred six participants performed dualtask walking with an functional nearinfrared spectroscopy sensor
hemoglobin variability was mean detrended time series of functional nearinfrared spectroscopyderived hemoglobin signal
hemoglobin variability was calculated from the sd 
hemoglobin variability was calculated from range
functional nearinfrared spectroscopyderived hemoglobin signal evaluated during each walking task
hemoglobin variability was compared between groups
hemoglobin variability was compared between walking tasks with mixed model analyses
this was derived from the differences within the healthy control group
higher variability was observed during dualtask walking compared to usual walking
on the other hand task repetition increased variability in patients with parkinson disease
on the other hand task repetition increased variability in patients with aging disease
on the other hand task repetition demonstrated reduced variability in healthy controls
the movement disorder society unified parkinsons disease rating scale motor score correlated with hemoglobin range during usual walking among all participants
the movement disorder society unified parkinsons disease rating scale motor score correlated with hemoglobin standard deviation during usual walking among all participants
in this study we suggest a new way to interpret changes in hemoglobin variability
we relate increased hemoglobin variability to flexible adaptation to environmental challenges
we decreased hemoglobin variability to the stability of performance
we results show that 57 healthy controls are limited in parkinson disease
we results show that two hundred six participants are limited in aging disease
we results show that 149 patients with idiopathic parkinson disease are limited in aging disease
we results show that 149 patients with idiopathic parkinson disease are limited in parkinson disease
we results show that 57 healthy controls are limited in aging disease
we results show that two hundred six participants are limited in parkinson disease
however further investigation of these concepts is required
moreover hemoglobin variability measures are an important aspect of brain function
brain function that add new insights into the role of prefrontal cortex during walking with parkinson disease
