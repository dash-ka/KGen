the relevance of impaired microvascular tissuelevel reperfusion despite complete upstream macrovascular angiographic reperfusion in human stroke remains controversial
we investigated clinicalradiologic features of this phenomenon associations with outcomes in 3 international randomized controlled thrombectomy trials with prespecified followup perfusion imaging

noreflow was defined as regions of visually demonstrable persistent hypoperfusion on relative cerebral blood volume within the infarct
noreflow was defined as regions of visually demonstrable persistent hypoperfusion on flow maps within the infarct
noreflow was verified quantitatively by over 15 percent asymmetry compared to a mirror homolog in the absence of carotid stenosis or reocclusion
regions of noreflow were identified in 33 of 130 patients
regions of noreflow encompassed a median of 602 percent of the infarct volume
regions of noreflow involved both cortical regions
regions of noreflow involved both subcortical regions
patients with noreflow had a median 252 percent relative cerebral blood volume interside reduction and 191 percent relative cerebral blood flow reduction but similar mean transit time within the infarcted region
baseline characteristics were similar between patients with
those without noreflow
the presence of noreflow was being dead at 90 days as assessed by the modified rankin scale in multivariable analysis
the presence of noreflow was associated with hemorrhagic transformation greater infarct growth reduced nih stroke scale score improvement at 24 hours
the presence of noreflow was being dependent at 90 days as assessed by the modified rankin scale in multivariable analysis
cerebral noreflow in humans is associated with posttreatment complications
cerebral noreflow in humans can be detected by the modified rankin scale in multivariable analysis characteristic perfusion imaging profile

cerebral noreflow in humans is being dead
cerebral noreflow in humans is common
cerebral noreflow in humans is being dependent
further studies are warranted
further studies evaluating the role of noreflow in secondary injury after angiographic reperfusion
this study provides class ii evidence that cerebral noreflow on ct is associated with posttreatment complications
this study provides class ii evidence that mri perfusion imaging at 24 hours is associated with poor 3month functional outcome
