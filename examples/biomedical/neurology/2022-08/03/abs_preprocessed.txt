lateonset epilepsy affects a significant number of individuals
head injury is also a risk factor for acquired epilepsy
the degree to which prior head injury may contribute to lateonset epilepsy is less well understood
our objective was to determine subsequent development of lateonset epilepsy
our objective was to determine the association between head injury
included were 8872 participants
8872 participants enrolled in the atherosclerosis risk in communities study with continuous centers for medicare services feeforservice coverage
we identified head injuries thazard ratioough 2018 from linked medicare services feeforservice coverage fee for service claims for emergency department care
we identified head injuries thazard ratioough 2018 from linked medicare services feeforservice coverage fee for service claims for inpatient department care
we identified head injuries thazard ratioough 2018 from linked medicare services feeforservice coverage fee for service claims for active surveillance of hospitalizations
we identified head injuries thazard ratioough 2018 from linked medicare services feeforservice coverage fee for service claims for participant selfreport
lateonset epilepsy cases thazard ratioough 2018 were identified from linked medicare services feeforservice coverage feeforservice claims
our used cox proportional hazards models to evaluate associations of head injury with lateonset epilepsy adjusting for cardiovascular
our used cox proportional hazards models to evaluate associations of head injury with lateonset epilepsy adjusting for demographic
our used cox proportional hazards models to evaluate associations of head injury with lateonset epilepsy adjusting for lifestyle factors
the adjusted hazard ratio for developing lateonset epilepsy after a history of head injury was 188
there was evidence for doseresponse associations with greater risk for lateonset epilepsy with more severe head injury
there was evidence for doseresponse associations with greater risk for lateonset epilepsy with increasing number of prior head injuries
associations with lateonset epilepsy were significant for head injuries sustained at older age
associations with lateonset epilepsy were significant for head injuries not for head injuries sustained at younger age
there was evidence for higher risk for lateonset epilepsy after a greater number of prior head injuries
there was evidence for higher risk for lateonset epilepsy after more severe head injuries
head injury was associated with increased risk of developing lateonset epilepsy particularly when head injuries were sustained at an older age
this study provides class i evidence that an increased risk of lateonset epilepsy increases further with multiple head injuries
this study provides class i evidence that an increased risk of lateonset epilepsy increases further with more severe head injuries
this study provides class i evidence that an increased risk of lateonset epilepsy is associated with head injury
