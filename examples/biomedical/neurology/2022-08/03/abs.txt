Late-onset epilepsy affects a significant number of individuals . Head injury is also a risk factor for acquired epilepsy, but the degree to which prior head injury may contribute to Late-onset epilepsy is less well understood . Our objective was to determine the association between head injury and subsequent development of Late-onset epilepsy .

Included were 8,872 participants enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study with continuous Centers for Medicare Services fee-for-service coverage . We identified head injuries thazard ratioough 2018 from linked Medicare fee for service claims for inpatient department care, emergency department care, active surveillance of hospitalizations, and participant self-report . Late-onset epilepsy cases thazard ratioough 2018 were identified from linked Medicare  fee-for-service claims . We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate associations of head injury with Late-onset epilepsy, adjusting for demographic, cardiovascular, and lifestyle factors .

The adjusted hazard ratio for developing Late-onset epilepsy after a history of head injury was 1.88 . There was evidence for doseâ€“response associations with greater risk for Late-onset epilepsy with increasing number of prior head injuries and with more severe head injury . Associations with Late-onset epilepsy were significant for head injuries sustained at older age, but not for head injuries sustained at younger age .

Head injury was associated with increased risk of developing Late-onset epilepsy, particularly when head injuries were sustained at an older age, and there was evidence for higher risk for Late-onset epilepsy after a greater number of prior head injuries and after more severe head injuries .

This study provides Class I evidence that an increased risk of late-onset epilepsy is associated with head injury and that this risk increases further with multiple and more severe head injuries .
