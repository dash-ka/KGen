clinical data were collected in a longitudinal prospective database of pregnant women with epilepsy at brigham hospital
clinical data were collected in a longitudinal prospective database of pregnant women with epilepsy at womens hospital
baseline seizure frequency was calculated for the 9 months before conception
within each individual participant
whether seizure frequency increased during pregnancy was determined
whether seizure frequency increased during the postpartum period was determined
seizure frequency was calculated for each 4week interval during pregnancy
generalized were applied
generalized estimating equations for logistic regression
ninetynine patients contributing 114 pregnancies
ninetynine patients were included from 2013 to 2018
increased seizure frequency generalized epilepsy
increased seizure frequency occurred more often during pregnancies of women with focal
among women with focal epilepsy increased seizure frequency occurred more often in those with frontal lobe epilepsy
there was no difference generalized
there was no difference in seizure worsening in the postpartum period between the focal
there was frontal focal epilepsy groups
there was other focal epilepsy groups
pregnancies on polytherapy had higher odds of seizure worsening compared to monotherapy regardless of the epilepsy type
pregnancies on polytherapy had higher odds of seizure worsening compared to monotherapy regardless of the medication type
a lack of preconception seizure freedom was also associated with increased seizure frequency during pregnancy
women with focal epilepsy have higher likelihood of seizure worsening during pregnancy compared to women with generalized epilepsy
frontal lobe epilepsy poses an especially elevated risk
polytherapy of preconception seizure freedom are additional predictors for an increased likelihood of seizure worsening
lack of preconception seizure freedom are additional predictors for an increased likelihood of seizure worsening
