To assess whether increased seizure frequency during pregnancy and postpartum is influenced by epilepsy type, seizure location, and antiseizure medications .

Clinical data were collected in a longitudinal prospective database of pregnant women with epilepsy at Brigham and Womens Hospital . Within each individual participant, baseline seizure frequency was calculated for the 9 months before conception, and whether seizure frequency increased during pregnancy or the postpartum period was determined . Seizure frequency was calculated for each 4-week interval during pregnancy . Generalized estimating equations for logistic regression were applied .

Ninety-nine patients contributing 114 pregnancies were included from 2013 to 2018 . Increased seizure frequency occurred more often during pregnancies of women with focal vs generalized epilepsy . Among women with focal epilepsy, increased seizure frequency occurred more often in those with frontal lobe epilepsy . There was no difference in seizure worsening in the postpartum period between the focal and generalized or frontal and other focal epilepsy groups . Pregnancies on polytherapy had higher odds of seizure worsening compared to monotherapy, regardless of the medication or epilepsy type . A lack of preconception seizure freedom was also associated with increased seizure frequency during pregnancy .

Women with focal epilepsy have higher likelihood of seizure worsening during pregnancy compared to women with generalized epilepsy . frontal lobe epilepsy poses an especially elevated risk . Polytherapy and lack of preconception seizure freedom are additional predictors for an increased likelihood of seizure worsening .
