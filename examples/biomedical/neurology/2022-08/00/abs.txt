Findings of association between coronavirus disease 2019 and stroke remain inconsistent, ranging from significant association to absence of association to less than expected ischemic stroke among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 . The current study examined the association between coronavirus disease 2019  and risk of acute ischemic stroke .

We included 37,379 Medicare fee-for-service (fee-for-service) beneficiaries aged over 65 years diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019  from April 1, 2020, through February 28, 2021, and acute ischemic stroke hospitalization from January 1, 2019, through February 28, 2021 . We used a self-controlled case series design to examine the association between coronavirus disease 2019  and acute ischemic stroke and estimated the incidence rate ratios by comparing incidence of acute ischemic stroke in risk periods vs control periods.

Among 37,379 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with coronavirus disease 2019  and acute ischemic stroke, the median age at diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019  was 80.4 years and 56.7 percent were women. When acute ischemic stroke at day of exposure was included in the risk periods, incidence rate ratios  at 0–3, 4–7, 8–14, and 15–28 days following coronavirus disease 2019  diagnosis were 10.3 .

Risk of acute ischemic stroke among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries was 10 times as high during the first 3 days after diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019  as during the control period and the risk associated with coronavirus disease 2019  appeared to be stronger among those aged 65–74 years and those without prior history of stroke .

This study provides Class IV evidence that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is associated with increased risk of acute ischemic stroke in the first 3 days after diagnosis in Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries over 65 years of age .
