findings of risk of acute ischemic stroke the current study remain inconsistent ranging from significant association to absence of association to less than expected ischemic stroke among hospitalized patients with the current study
findings of the association between coronavirus disease 2019 the current study remain inconsistent ranging from significant association to absence of association to less than expected ischemic stroke among hospitalized patients with the current study
the current study examined the association between the current study and risk of acute ischemic stroke
65 years diagnosed with the current study from april 1 2020 through february 28 2021
37379 medicare feeforservice  feeforservice  beneficiaries aged over 65 years
we included 37379 medicare feeforservice  feeforservice  beneficiaries from january 1 2019 through february 28 2021
65 years diagnosed with the current study from april 1 2020 through acute ischemic stroke hospitalization
we used a selfcontrolled case series design to examine risk of acute ischemic stroke the current study
we used a selfcontrolled case series design to examine the association between coronavirus disease 2019
we estimated the incidence rate ratios by comparing incidence of acute ischemic stroke in risk periods
we estimated the incidence rate ratios by comparing incidence of acute ischemic stroke in control periods
among 37379 medicare feeforservice beneficiaries with acute ischemic stroke
among 37379 medicare feeforservice beneficiaries with the current study
567 percent were women
the median age at 2019 diagnosis was 804 years
when acute ischemic stroke at day of exposure was included in the risk periods 1528 days following coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis were 103
when acute ischemic stroke at day of exposure was included in the risk periods 47  were 103
when acute ischemic stroke at day of exposure was included in the risk periods 814 were 103
when acute ischemic stroke at day of exposure was included in the risk periods incidence rate ratios at 03 were 103
the risk associated with the current study
the risk appeared to be stronger among those without prior history of stroke
the risk appeared to be stronger among those aged 6574 years without prior history of stroke
risk of acute ischemic stroke among medicare feeforservice beneficiaries was 10 times as high during the first 3 days after diagnosis of the current study 2019 as during the control period
the current study provides class iv evidence that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is associated with increased risk of acute ischemic stroke in the first 3 days after diagnosis in medicare feeforservice beneficiaries over 65 years of age
