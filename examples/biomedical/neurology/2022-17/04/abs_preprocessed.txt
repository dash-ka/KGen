chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health problem
a worldwide public health problem that is recognized as an established risk factor for stroke
kidney disease remains unclear whether kidney disease distribution are consistent across ischemic stroke subtypes in patients with renal impairment
kidney disease remains unclear whether clinical impact are consistent across ischemic stroke subtypes in patients with renal impairment
we examined whether renal impairment was associated with functional outcomes after each stroke subtype
we examined whether renal impairment was associated with the proportion of each stroke subtype vs ischemic stroke overall after each stroke subtype
study participants were 10392 adult patients with an acute stroke from the register of the japan stroke data bank a hospitalbased multicenter stroke registration database between october 2016
study participants were 10392 adult patients with december 2019
december 2019 whose a dipstick proteinuria result were available
december 2019 whose baseline serum creatinine levels were available
all ischemic strokes were classified according to the trial of org 10172 in acute stroke treatment criteria
unfavorable functional outcome was defined as modified rankin scale score 36 at discharge
mixed effect logistic regression was used to determine dipstick proteinuria over 1 adjusted for covariates
the estimated glomerular filtration rate estimated glomerular filtration rate strata
the outcomes estimated glomerular filtration rate strata
mixed effect logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between the outcomes
mixed effect logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between the estimated glomerular filtration rate
renal impairment contributes to clinical effects across specific stroke subtypes particularly evident in cardioembolic stroke
renal impairment contributes to the different distributions across specific stroke subtypes particularly evident in cardioembolic stroke
renal impairment contributes to clinical effects across specific stroke subtypes particularly evident in small vessel occlusion
renal impairment contributes to the different distributions across specific stroke subtypes particularly evident in small vessel occlusion
this possibly indicates potentially enhancing pathways
this possibly indicates shared mechanisms of susceptibility
