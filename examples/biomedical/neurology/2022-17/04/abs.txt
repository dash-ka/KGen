Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health problem that is recognized as an established risk factor for stroke . It remains unclear whether its distribution and clinical impact are consistent across ischemic stroke subtypes in patients with renal impairment . We examined whether renal impairment was associated with the proportion of each stroke subtype vs ischemic stroke overall and with functional outcomes after each stroke subtype .

Study participants were 10,392 adult patients with an acute stroke from the register of the Japan Stroke Data Bank, a hospital-based multicenter stroke registration database, between October 2016 and December 2019, whose baseline serum creatinine levels or a dipstick proteinuria result were available . All ischemic strokes were classified according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria . Unfavorable functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score 3â€“6 at discharge . Mixed effect logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between the outcomes and the estimated glomerular filtration rate, estimated glomerular filtration rate strata, or dipstick proteinuria over 1 adjusted for covariates .


Renal impairment contributes to the different distributions and clinical effects across specific stroke subtypes, particularly evident in cardioembolic stroke and small vessel occlusion . This possibly indicates shared mechanisms of susceptibility and potentially enhancing pathways .
