To explore the relationship between slowly expanding lesions on MRI and disability in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis .

We retrospectively studied 345 patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis enrolled in the MS-SMART trial . They underwent brain MRI at baseline and at 24 and 96 weeks . Definite slowly expanding lesions were defined as concentrically expanding T2 lesions, as assessed by nonlinear deformation of volumetric T1-weighted images . Associations of slowly expanding lesion volumes with other MRI metrics and disability were assessed through Pearson correlations and regression analyses .

Averaged across patients, 29 percent of T2 lesions were classified as being definite slowly expanding lesions . A greater volume of definite slowly expanding lesions correlated with a higher total baseline T2 lesion volume and percentage brain volume reduction, a higher number of new persisting T1 black holes, and, in a subset of 106 patients, with a greater reduction in magnetization transfer ratio . In regression analyses, a higher definite slowly expanding lesion volume was associated with increasing disability, as assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, z scores of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite, Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task, and increased risk of disability progression .

Definite slowly expanding lesions represent almost one-third of T2 lesions in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis . They are associated with neurodegenerative MRI markers and related to clinical worsening, suggesting that they may contribute to disease progression and be a new target for therapeutic interventions .
