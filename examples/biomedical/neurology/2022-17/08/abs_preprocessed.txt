to explore the relationship between slowly expanding lesions on brain mri
to explore the relationship between slowly expanding disability in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis
we retrospectively studied 345 patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis
secondary progressive multiple sclerosis enrolled in the mssmart trial
345 patients underwent brain mri at baseline
345 patients underwent brain mri at at 24 weeks
345 patients underwent brain mri at 96 weeks
definite slowly expanding lesions were defined as concentrically expanding t2 lesions as assessed by nonlinear deformation of volumetric t1weighted images
associations of slowly expanding lesion volumes with other mri metrics were assessed through regression analyses
associations of slowly expanding lesion volumes with disability were assessed through regression analyses
associations of slowly expanding lesion volumes with other mri metrics were assessed through 96 weeks correlations
associations of slowly expanding lesion volumes with disability were assessed through at 24 weeks correlations
associations of slowly expanding lesion volumes with disability were assessed through 96 weeks correlations
associations of slowly expanding lesion volumes with other mri metrics were assessed through at 24 weeks correlations
averaged across patients 29 percent of t2 lesions were classified as being definite slowly expanding lesions
a greater volume of definite slowly expanding lesions correlated with a higher total baseline t2 lesion volume a higher number of new persisting t1 black holes
a greater volume of definite slowly expanding lesions correlated with a higher total baseline t2 percentage brain volume reduction a higher number of new persisting t1  in a subset of 106 patients with a greater reduction in magnetization transfer ratio

in regression analyses a higher definite slowly expanding lesion volume was associated with increasing disability as assessed by the expanded disability status scale z scores of the multiple sclerosis functional composite walk paced auditory serial addition task
in regression analyses a higher definite slowly expanding lesion volume was associated with increasing disability as assessed by the expanded disability status scale z scores of the multiple sclerosis functional composite increased risk of disability progression

in regression analyses a higher definite slowly expanding lesion volume was associated with increasing disability as assessed by the expanded disability status scale z scores of the multiple sclerosis functional composite walk test
definite slowly expanding lesions represent almost onethird of t2 lesions in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis
almost onethird of t2 lesions in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis are related to clinical worsening suggesting that almost onethird of t2 lesions in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis may contribute to disease progression
almost onethird of t2 lesions in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis are related to clinical worsening suggesting that almost onethird of t2 lesions in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis may be a new target for therapeutic interventions
almost onethird of t2 lesions in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis are associated with neurodegenerative mri markers
