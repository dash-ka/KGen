whiter matter reactivity averaged across the entire brain was lower in participants with cerebral amyloid angiopathy compared to healthy controls with a predominantly posterior distribution of lower reactivity in both groups
gray averaged across the entire brain was lower in participants with alzheimer disease dementia compared to healthy controls with a predominantly posterior distribution of lower reactivity in both groups

higher white matter hyperintensity volume was associated with lower white matter reactivity
higher gray matter reactivity was associated with better global cognitive function memory
higher white matter reactivity was associated with higher memory
higher white matter reactivity was associated with processing speed
