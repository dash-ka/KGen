Beta-amyloid staging models assume a single spatial-temporal progression of amyloid accumulation . We assessed evidence for Beta-amyloid accumulation subtypes by applying the data-driven Subtype and Stage Inference model to amyloid-PET data .

Amyloid-PET data of 3,010 participants were pooled from 6 cohorts . Standardized uptake value ratios were calculated for 17 regions . We applied the Subtype and Stage Inference algorithm to identify consistent subtypes in the pooled dataset based on the cross-validation information criterion and the most probable subtype/stage classification per scan . The effects of demographics and risk factors on subtype assignment were assessed using multinomial logistic regression .

Participants were mostly cognitively unimpaired, had a mean age of 68.72 years, 42.1 percent were APOE Epsilon4 carriers, and 51.8 percent were female . A 1-subtype model recovered the traditional amyloid accumulation trajectory, but Subtype and Stage Inference identified 3 optimal subtypes, referred to as frontal, parietal, and occipital based on the first regions to show abnormality . Of the 788 with strong subtype assignment, the majority was assigned to frontal, followed by parietal and occipital subtypes . Significant differences across subtypes included distinct proportions of APOE Epsilon4 carriers, participants with dementia, and lower age for the parietal subtype . Higher amyloid and CSF p-tau burden was observed for the frontal subtype . parietal and occipital subtypes did not differ . At follow-up, most participants maintained baseline subtype assignment and 25.6 percent progressed to a later stage .

Whereas a 1-trajectory model recovers the established pattern of amyloid accumulation, Subtype and Stage Inference determined that 3 subtypes were optimal, showing distinct associations with Alzheimer disease risk factors . Further analyses to determine clinical utility are warranted .
