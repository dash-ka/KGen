betaamyloid staging models assume a single spatialtemporal progression of amyloid accumulation
we assessed evidence for betaamyloid accumulation subtypes by applying stage inference model to amyloidpet data
we assessed evidence for betaamyloid accumulation subtypes by applying the datadriven subtype to amyloidpet data
amyloidpet data of 3010 participants were pooled from 6 cohorts
standardized uptake value ratios were calculated for 17 regions
we applied the subtype to identify consistent subtypes in the pooled dataset
we applied stage inference algorithm to identify consistent subtypes in the pooled dataset
the pooled dataset based on the crossvalidation information criterion
the pooled dataset based on the most probable subtypestage classification per scan
the effects of risk factors on subtype assignment were assessed using multinomial logistic regression
the effects of demographics on subtype assignment were assessed using multinomial logistic regression
participants were mostly cognitively unimpaired had a mean age of 6872 years 421 percent were apoe epsilon4 carriers and 518 percent were female
subtype inference identified 3 optimal subtypes referred to as frontal based on the first regions to show abnormality
stage inference identified 3 optimal subtypes referred to parietal based on the first regions to show abnormality
subtype inference identified 3 optimal subtypes referred to parietal based on the first regions to show abnormality
stage inference identified 3 optimal subtypes referred to occipital based on the first regions to show abnormality
stage inference identified 3 optimal subtypes referred to as frontal based on the first regions to show abnormality
a 1subtype model recovered the traditional amyloid accumulation trajectory
subtype inference identified 3 optimal subtypes referred to occipital based on the first regions to show abnormality
frontal followed by occipital subtypes
of the 788 with strong subtype assignment the majority was assigned to frontal
frontal followed by parietal subtypes
significant differences across subtypes included distinct proportions of apoe epsilon4 carriers
significant differences across subtypes included lower age for the parietal subtype
significant differences across subtypes included participants with dementia
csf ptau burden was observed for the parietal subtype
higher amyloid was observed for the parietal subtype
occipital subtypes did not differ
parietal subtypes did not differ
at followup most participants maintained baseline subtype assignment progressed to a later stage
at followup most participants maintained 256 percent progressed to a later stage
whereas a 1trajectory model recovers the established pattern of amyloid accumulation stage inference determined that 3 subtypes were optimal showing distinct associations with alzheimer disease risk factors

further analyses to determine clinical utility are warranted
