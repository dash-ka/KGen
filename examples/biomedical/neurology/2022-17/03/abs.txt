To unravel whether Alzheimer diseaseâ€“related pathology or neurodegeneration plays a role in stroke etiology, we determined the effect of plasma levels Beta-amyloid, total-tau, and neurofilament light chain on risk of stroke and its subtypes .

Between 2002 and 2005, we measured plasma Beta-amyloid40, Beta-amyloid42, total-tau, and neurofilament light chain in 4,661 stroke-free participants from the population-based Rotterdam Study . We used Cox proportional-hazards models to determine the association between these markers with incident stroke for the entire cohort, per stroke subtype, and by median age, sex, APOE Epsilon4 carriership, and education .

After a mean follow-up of 10.8 years, 379 participants had a first-ever stroke . Log2 total-tau at baseline showed a nonlinear association with risk of any stroke and ischemic stroke. compared to the first quartile, the adjusted hazard ratio for the highest quartile total-tau was 1.68 for any stroke . Log2 neurofilament light chain was associated with an increased risk of any stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke . Log2 Beta-amyloid40, Beta-amyloid42, and Beta-amyloid42/40 ratio levels were not associated with stroke risk .

Participants with higher total-tau and neurofilament light chain at baseline had a higher risk of stroke and several stroke subtypes . These findings support the role of markers of neurodegeneration in the etiology of stroke .
