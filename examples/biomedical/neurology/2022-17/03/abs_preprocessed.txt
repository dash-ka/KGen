we used cox proportionalhazards models to determine the association between these markers with incident stroke for the entire cohort per stroke subtype
we used cox proportionalhazards models to determine the association between these markers by sex
we used cox proportionalhazards models to determine the association between these markers by median age
we used cox proportionalhazards models to determine the association between these markers by apoe epsilon4 carriership

after a mean followup of 108 years 379 participants had a firstever stroke
log2 totaltau at baseline showed a nonlinear association with risk of any stroke
log2 totaltau at baseline showed a nonlinear association with risk of ischemic stroke
compared to the first quartile the adjusted hazard ratio for the highest quartile totaltau was 168 for any stroke
log2 neurofilament light chain was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke
log2 neurofilament light chain was associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke
log2 neurofilament light chain was associated with an increased risk of any stroke
betaamyloid4240 ratio levels were not associated with stroke risk
betaamyloid42 were not associated with stroke risk
log2 betaamyloid40 were not associated with stroke risk
participants with higher totaltau at baseline had a higher risk of stroke stroke subtypes
participants with neurofilament light chain at baseline had a higher risk of several stroke subtypes
participants with neurofilament light chain at baseline had a higher risk of stroke stroke subtypes
participants with higher totaltau at baseline had a higher risk of several stroke subtypes
these findings support the role of markers of neurodegeneration in the etiology of stroke
