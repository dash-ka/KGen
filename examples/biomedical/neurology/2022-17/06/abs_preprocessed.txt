multiple factors in which psychiatric comorbid conditions play a pivotal role
quality of life in people with epilepsy is determined by multiple factors
epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of multiple unprovoked seizures
therefore understanding quality of life across epilepsy phenotypes is an important step toward improved outcomes
therefore understanding the interplay between comorbid conditions across epilepsy phenotypes is an important step toward improved outcomes
here we report the impact of quality of life across distinct epilepsy phenotypes in a cohort of postnineeleven veterans with high rates of traumatic brain injury
this observational cohort study from the veterans health administration included postnineeleven veterans with epilepsy
a process integrating chart abstraction
epilepsy controlled with drugresistant posttraumatic epilepsy
epilepsy controlled with posttraumatic epilepsy
a process was used to classify patients into 1 of 4 groups epilepsy
epilepsy controlled with drugresistant epilepsy
a process integrating an epilepsy identification algorithm
a process integrating selfreported measures
epilepsy controlled with medications
summary scores for 6 quality of life measures were compared across the groups after adjustment for sex of comorbid conditions
summary scores for 6 quality of life measures were compared across the groups after adjustment for age of comorbid conditions
summary scores for 6 quality of life measures were compared across the groups after adjustment for number of comorbid conditions
a total of 529 survey respondents with epilepsy were included in the analysis
drugresistant epilepsy was more common in those with posttraumatic epilepsy compared with those with both posttraumatic epilepsy
drugresistant epilepsy was more common in those with posttraumatic epilepsy compared with those with drugresistant epilepsy
patients with posttraumatic epilepsy had significantly more comorbid conditions in health records than those with drugresistant epilepsy
patients with drugresistant posttraumatic epilepsy had significantly more comorbid conditions in health records than those with both posttraumatic epilepsy
patients with posttraumatic epilepsy had significantly more comorbid conditions in health records than those with both posttraumatic epilepsy
patients with drugresistant posttraumatic epilepsy had significantly more comorbid conditions in health records than those with drugresistant epilepsy
those with drugresistant epilepsy reported the lowest quality of life across all 6 measures
this persisted after adjustment in further linear analyses
this persisted after adjustment for comorbid conditions
those with both posttraumatic epilepsy reported the lowest quality of life across all 6 measures
among those with posttraumatic epilepsy drugresistant epilepsy prevalence was significantly higher than prevalence of nontraumatic epilepsies
posttraumatic epilepsy was also associated with worse overall quality of life compared to nontraumatic epilepsies
posttraumatic epilepsy was also associated with higher burden of comorbidity compared to nontraumatic epilepsies
this atrisk group are distinctly vulnerable to the comorbid conditions
the comorbid conditions associated with epilepsy
the comorbid conditions associated with traumatic brain injury
future studies aimed at developing antiepileptogenic therapies
future studies aimed at elucidating the factors
the factors associated with adverse health outcomes
this atrisk group should be the focus of future studies
