a recent food concerning an arrhythmogenic potential of lamotrigine created concern in the neurologic community
drug administration warning concerning an arrhythmogenic potential of lamotrigine created concern in the neurologic community
a recent food concerning an arrhythmogenic potential of lamotrigine was based on in vitro studies
no clinically relevant risk was considered
drug administration warning concerning an arrhythmogenic potential of lamotrigine was based on in vitro studies
this rapid systematic review aims to elucidate the risk of lamotrigine on ecg abnormalities
this rapid systematic review aims to elucidate the risk of lamotrigine on sudden death
we conducted a systematic search of ovid medline including randomized observational studies and studies of people with or without epilepsy with the outcome measures sudden unexpected death in epilepsy
we conducted a systematic search of ovid embase including randomized controlled trials with or without epilepsy with the outcome measures the development or worsening of ecg abnormalities
we conducted a systematic search of ovid medline including randomized observational studies and studies of people with or without epilepsy with the outcome measures sudden unexpected death in sudden cardiac death

we evaluated the sudden death definitions included studies as some could have used overlapping definitions
we evaluated the sudden death definitions included studies as some could have used unclear definitions
the sudden death definitions used in all
we used the american academy of neurology risk of bias tool to evaluate the class of the grade approach to evaluate we confidence in the evidence
we used the american academy of neurology risk of bias tool to evaluate the class of evidence to evaluate we confidence in the evidence
24962 participants of whom 2326 used lamotrigine
we included 26 studies with 24962 participants
twelve studies showed no significant risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy for lamotrigine users
3 studies with unclear sudden death definitions did not report an elevated risk of death in lamotrigine users compared to controls
one study reporting on sudden cardiac death did not report an elevated risk of death in lamotrigine users compared to controls
10 studies reporting on ecg measures
in 10 studies there was no statistically significant increased risk among lamotrigine users except in these 2 studies
these 2 studies reported either slight increases in pr interval that the primary study authors believed to be related to an effect of lamotrigine
these 2 studies reported either slight increases in pr interval that the primary study authors believed to be related to structural cardiac differences
these 2 studies reported either slight increases in an increased pq interval that the primary study authors believed to be related to structural cardiac differences
these 2 studies reported either slight increases in an increased pq interval that the primary study authors believed to be related to an effect of lamotrigine
one study was rated class ii all others were iv
one study was rated class ii all others were class iii
we had very low confidence in the evidence following the grade assessment
none of these 2 studies examined the risk of lamotrigine in people with preexisting cardiac conditions
there is insufficient evidence to support that lamotrigine is associated with sudden death in people with or without epilepsy as compared to antiseizure medication or placebo due to low precision and inconsistency in the reported results
there is insufficient evidence to support that lamotrigine is associated with sudden death in people with or without epilepsy as compared to antiseizure medication or placebo due to the high risk of bias in most studies
there is insufficient evidence to support that lamotrigine is associated with ecg changes in people with or without epilepsy as compared to antiseizure medication or placebo due to low precision and inconsistency in the reported results
there is insufficient evidence to refute that lamotrigine is associated with ecg changes in people with or without epilepsy as compared to antiseizure medication or placebo due to the high risk of bias in most studies
