after surgery hippocampal specimens were processed for neuropathology examinations
fifteen patients with temporal lobe epilepsy were included
fifteen patients with 11 healthy controls were included
hippocampal analyses mean decrease in orientation dispersion index
orientation dispersion index comparing the pathologic side of patients with hippocampal sclerosis and their relative nonpathologic side relative nonpathologic side the pathologic side of patients without hippocampal sclerosis and healthy controls
hippocampal analyses resulted in a significant increase in fractional anisotropy
hippocampal analyses mean diffusivity in orientation dispersion index
