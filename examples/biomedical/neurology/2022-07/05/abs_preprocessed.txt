to describe the phenotypic spectrum of dystrophinopathy in a large cohort of individuals with duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications who may be particularly amenable to therapies 5 internal ribosome entry site
therapies directed at restoring expression of either fulllength dystrophin through utilization of the duchenne muscular dystrophy exon
therapies directed at restoring expression of either nearly fulllength dystrophin through utilization of the duchenne muscular dystrophy exon
in this retrospective observational study we analyzed data from large genotypephenotype databases and classified participants into duchenne muscular dystrophy intermediate muscular dystrophy or becker muscular dystrophy phenotypes
logrank tests for timetoevent variables were used to compare age at loss of ambulation in participants with duchenne muscular dystrophy exon controls without duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications for comparisons between steroidtreated 2 duplications
logrank tests for timetoevent variables were used to compare age at loss of ambulation in participants with duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications exon 2 duplications in the udp database 2 duplications
logrank tests for timetoevent variables were used to compare age at loss of ambulation in participants with duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications exon 2 duplications for comparisons between steroidnaive participants with duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications

among 66 participants with duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications 61 percent were classified as 30 percent as becker muscular dystrophy
among 66 participants with duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications 61 percent were classified as duchenne muscular dystrophy as becker muscular dystrophy
among 66 participants with duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications 61 percent were classified as 9 percent as intermediate muscular dystrophy as becker muscular dystrophy
75 percent had been on corticosteroids for at least 6 months
median age at last observation was 154 years
age at loss of ambulation differed significantly between participants with duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications duchenne muscular dystrophy 2 duplications duchenne muscular dystrophy
age at loss of ambulation differed significantly between participants with duchenne muscular dystrophy exon historical controls without duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications duchenne muscular dystrophy
24 of 55 participants with adequate cardiac data had cardiomyopathy
valid spirometry was limited
valid spirometry suggested a delay in the typical agerelated decline in forced vital capacity
some patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications display a milder disease course than controls without duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications duchenne muscular dystrophy
prolonged ambulation with corticosteroids suggests the potential of internal ribosome entry site activation as a molecular mechanism
as duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplicationstargeted therapies reach clinical applications this information is critical to aid in the interpretation of the efficacy of new treatments
