To describe the phenotypic spectrum of dystrophinopathy in a large cohort of individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications, who may be particularly amenable to therapies directed at restoring expression of either full-length dystrophin or nearly full-length dystrophin through utilization of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 5 internal ribosome entry site .

In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed data from large genotypeâ€“phenotype databases and classified participants into Duchenne muscular dystrophy, intermediate muscular dystrophy, or Becker muscular dystrophy phenotypes. Log-rank tests for time-to-event variables were used to compare age at loss of ambulation in participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications vs controls without Duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications in the UDP database and for comparisons between steroid-treated vs steroid-naive participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications .

Among 66 participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications, 61 percent were classified as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 9 percent as intermediate muscular dystrophy, and 30 percent as Becker muscular dystrophy . Median age at last observation was 15.4 years and 75 percent had been on corticosteroids for at least 6 months . Age at loss of ambulation differed significantly between participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications Duchenne muscular dystrophy and historical controls without Duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications Duchenne muscular dystrophy . Valid spirometry was limited but suggested a delay in the typical age-related decline in forced vital capacity and 24 of 55 participants with adequate cardiac data had cardiomyopathy .

Some patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications display a milder disease course than controls without Duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and prolonged ambulation with corticosteroids suggests the potential of internal ribosome entry site activation as a molecular mechanism . As Duchenne muscular dystrophy exon 2 duplications-targeted therapies reach clinical applications, this information is critical to aid in the interpretation of the efficacy of new treatments .
