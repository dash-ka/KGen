diffusion mri scans were collected on cognitively normal participants and patients with alzheimer disease severity
diffusion mri scans were collected on cognitively normal participants and patients with early mild cognitive impairment
diffusion mri scans were collected on cognitively normal participants and patients with late mild cognitive impairment
free water were calculated in the locus coeruleus to transentorhinal cortex tract 4 magnocellular regions of hippocampus
free water were calculated in the locus coeruleus to transentorhinal cortex tract 4 magnocellular regions of the basal forebrain
free watercorrected fractional anisotropy were calculated in the locus coeruleus to transentorhinal cortex tract 4 magnocellular regions of entorhinal cortex

free water were calculated in the locus coeruleus to transentorhinal cortex tract 4 magnocellular regions of entorhinal cortex
all patients underwent a battery of cognitive assessments neurofilament light chain levels were measured in plasma samples
free water was significantly higher in patients with early mild cognitive impairment compared to hippocampus
free water was significantly higher in patients with early mild cognitive impairment compared to cognitively normal in the locus coeruleus to transentorhinal cortex tract
free water was significantly higher in patients with early mild cognitive impairment compared to nucleus basalis of meynert
all the examined
free water was significantly higher in those with alzheimer disease severity compared to cognitively normal in all the regions
in alzheimer diseasedition locus coeruleus to transentorhinal cortex tract positively correlated with all 5 cognitive impairment metrics
in alzheimer diseasedition entorhinal cortex positively correlated with all 5 cognitive impairment metrics
in alzheimer diseasedition locus coeruleus to transentorhinal cortex tract positively correlated with neurofilament light chain levels
in alzheimer diseasedition nucleus basalis of meynert positively correlated with neurofilament light chain levels
in alzheimer diseasedition free water in the hippocampus positively correlated with all 5 cognitive impairment metrics
in alzheimer diseasedition free water in the hippocampus positively correlated with neurofilament light chain levels
in alzheimer diseasedition entorhinal cortex positively correlated with neurofilament light chain levels
in alzheimer diseasedition nucleus basalis of meynert positively correlated with all 5 cognitive impairment metrics
these results show that higher free water is associated with neurofilament light chain
these results show that higher free water is associated with greater clinical diagnosis severity
these results show that higher free water is associated with cognitive impairment
these results also suggest that free water elevation occurs in nucleus basalis of meynert from cognitively normal to early mild cognitive impairment while other basal forebrain regions are not affected until a later stage of alzheimer disease severity

structural changes related to cognitive impairment
free water is a clinically relevant and noninvasive early marker of structural changes
