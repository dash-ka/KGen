sex adjusted
body dimension adjusted normal values
body dimension were developed
age adjusted
the fifth percentile for timed vibration thresholds were selected as normal cutoff points
the fifth percentile for meissner corpuscle densities were selected as normal cutoff points
the fifth percentile for 95th percentile for mf touchpressure thresholds were selected as normal cutoff points
participants were 9 to 89 years of age
sex were uniformly distributed
age were uniformly distributed
timed touchpressure thresholds were less sensitive with increasing age
timed vibration thresholds were more sensitive in the hand than in the leg or foot within individuals
timed vibration thresholds were less sensitive with increasing age
timed touchpressure thresholds were more sensitive in the hand than in the leg or foot within individuals
timed vibration thresholds did not differ by body dimensions
timed vibration thresholds did not differ by sex dimensions
touchpressure thresholds were lower at digit v in the hand in women compared to men
touchpressure thresholds were lower at the thenar eminence in the hand in women compared to men
touchpressure thresholds did not differ by sex at other measurement locations
body dimensions did not affect touchpressure thresholds
there were no apparent agerelated floor effects for the 5th for timed vibration

meissner corpuscle densities also were highest at digit v at the arch within individuals
meissner corpuscle densities also were highest at lowest at the arch within individuals
meissner corpuscle densities also declined with age
lower densities seen in larger individuals
meissner corpuscle densities were affected by sex dimensions at all imaging sites with lower densities
