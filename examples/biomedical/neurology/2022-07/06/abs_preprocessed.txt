discoveries of dermatomyositisspecific antibodies in patients with dermatomyositis raised awareness of various myopathologic features among antibody subtypes
however only perifascicular atrophy were officially included as definitive pathologic criteria for dermatomyositis classification
however perifascicular myxovirus resistant protein a overexpression were officially included as definitive pathologic criteria for dermatomyositis classification
we aimed to demonstrate myopathologic features in myxovirus resistant protein apositive dermatomyositis to determine characteristic myopathologic features in different dmsa subtypes
we performed a retrospective pathology review of muscle biopsies of patients with dermatomyositis diagnosed between january 2009
we performed a retrospective pathology review of muscle biopsies of patients with dermatomyositis december 2020 in a tertiary laboratory for muscle diseases
we included all muscle biopsies with sarcoplasmic expression for myxovirus resistant protein a and seropositivity for all dermatomyositisspecific antibodies
myxovirus resistant protein apositive muscle biopsies that tested negative for all dermatomyositisspecific antibodies
myxovirus resistant protein apositive muscle biopsies were included as seronegative dermatomyositis
we evaluated immunohistochemical study commonly used in the diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy
we evaluated histologic features
histologic features stratified according to 4 pathology domains
we evaluated enzyme histochemistry
histologic features stratified according to histologic features of interest by histochemistry
we performed ultrastructural studies of 54 available specimens
a total of 256 patients were included
of a total of 256 patients 249 patients were positive for 1 of the 5 dermatomyositisspecific antibodies were negative for all 5 dermatomyositisspecific antibodies
of a total of 256 patients 249 patients were positive for 1 of 7 patients were negative for all 5 dermatomyositisspecific antibodies
we describe a comprehensive serologicpathologic correlation of dermatomyositis primarily using myxovirus resistant protein a expression as an inclusion criterion
distinctive myopathologic features suggesting different underlying pathobiologic mechanisms in each subtype
in we study dermatomyositisspecific antibodies were associated with distinctive myopathologic features
