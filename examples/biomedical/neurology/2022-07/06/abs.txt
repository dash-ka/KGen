Discoveries of dermatomyositis-specific antibodies in patients with dermatomyositis raised awareness of various myopathologic features among antibody subtypes . However, only perifascicular atrophy and perifascicular myxovirus resistant protein A overexpression were officially included as definitive pathologic criteria for dermatomyositis classification . We aimed to demonstrate myopathologic features in myxovirus resistant protein A-positive dermatomyositis to determine characteristic myopathologic features in different DMSA subtypes .

We performed a retrospective pathology review of muscle biopsies of patients with dermatomyositis diagnosed between January 2009 and December 2020 in a tertiary laboratory for muscle diseases . We included all muscle biopsies with sarcoplasmic expression for myxovirus resistant protein A and seropositivity for dermatomyositis-specific antibodies . myxovirus resistant protein A-positive muscle biopsies that tested negative for all dermatomyositis-specific antibodies were included as seronegative dermatomyositis . We evaluated histologic features stratified according to 4 pathology domains and histologic features of interest by histochemistry, enzyme histochemistry, and immunohistochemical study commonly used in the diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy . We performed ultrastructural studies of 54 available specimens .

A total of 256 patients were included. Of these, 249 patients were positive for 1 of the 5 dermatomyositis-specific antibodies and 7 patients were negative for all 5 dermatomyositis-specific antibodies .

We describe a comprehensive serologicâ€“pathologic correlation of dermatomyositis primarily using myxovirus resistant protein A expression as an inclusion criterion . In our study, dermatomyositis-specific antibodies were associated with distinctive myopathologic features suggesting different underlying pathobiologic mechanisms in each subtype .
