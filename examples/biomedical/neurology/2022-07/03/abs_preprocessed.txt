both vascular and neurodegenerative mechanisms postulated
individuals with chronic kidney disease appear to be at increased risk of cognitive impairment with both vascular and neurodegenerative mechanisms
to explore the vascular hypothesis we studied the association between chronic kidney disease and dementia before and after stroke

among 2305 patients with tia 1174 had chronic kidney disease
among 2305 patients with stroke 1174 had chronic kidney disease
chronic kidney disease was associated with both preevent dementia
chronic kidney disease was associated with both postevent dementia
these associations attenuated after adjustment for covariates
the results were similar when a competing risk model was used
chronic kidney disease was more strongly associated with late postevent dementia particularly after minor stroke but not significantly so after adjustment
chronic kidney disease was more strongly associated with late postevent dementia particularly after tia but not significantly so after adjustment
in patients with tia chronic kidney disease was not independently associated with either postevent dementia suggesting that renalspecific mechanisms are unlikely to play an important role in aetiology
in patients with stroke chronic kidney disease was not independently associated with either postevent dementia suggesting that renalspecific mechanisms are unlikely to play an important role in aetiology
in patients with stroke chronic kidney disease was not independently associated with either preeventd dementia suggesting that renalspecific mechanisms are unlikely to play an important role in aetiology
