Individuals with chronic kidney disease appear to be at increased risk of cognitive impairment, with both vascular and neurodegenerative mechanisms postulated . To explore the vascular hypothesis, we studied the association between chronic kidney disease and dementia before and after TIA and stroke .

In a prospective, population-based cohort study of TIA and stroke, pre-event and new postevent dementia were ascertained through direct patient assessment and follow-up for 5 years, supplemented by review of hospital/primary care records . Associations between pre-event dementia and chronic kidney disease were examined using logistic regression and between postevent dementia and chronic kidney disease using Cox and competing risk regression models, adjusted for age, sex, education, stroke severity, prior stroke, white matter disease, diabetes mellitus, and dysphasia .

Among 2,305 patients with TIA and stroke, 1,174 had chronic kidney disease . chronic kidney disease was associated with both pre-event and postevent dementia, but these associations attenuated after adjustment for covariates . The results were similar when a competing risk model was used . chronic kidney disease was more strongly associated with late postevent dementia, particularly after TIA and minor stroke, but not significantly so after adjustment .

In patients with TIA and stroke, chronic kidney disease was not independently associated with either preeventd dementia or postevent dementia, suggesting that renal-specific mechanisms are unlikely to play an important role in aetiology .
