To determine the diagnostic accuracy of a plasma Amyloid-Beta 42/40 assay in classifying amyloid PET status across global research studies using samples collected by multiple centers that utilize different blood collection and processing protocols .

Methods Plasma samples were obtained from 3 large Alzheimer disease research cohorts in the United States, Australia, and Sweden . Plasma Amyloid-Beta 42/40 was measured by a high precision immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry assay and compared to the reference standards of amyloid PET and CSF Amyloid-Beta 42/40 .

In the combined cohort of 465 participants, plasma Amyloid-Beta 42/40 hAlzheimer disease good concordance with amyloid PET status. concordance improved with the inclusion of APOE Epsilon4 carrier status . The AUC of plasma Amyloid-Beta 42/40 with CSF amyloid status was 0.85 and improved to 0.93 with APOE Epsilon4 status . These findings were consistent across the 3 cohorts, despite differences in protocols . The assay performed similarly in both cognitively unimpaired and impaired individuals .

Plasma Amyloid-Beta 42/40 is a robust measure for detecting amyloid plaques and can be utilized to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, identify those at risk for future dementia due to Alzheimer disease, and improve the diversity of populations enrolled in Alzheimer disease research and clinical trials .

This study provides Class II evidence that plasma Amyloid-Beta 42/40, as measured by a high precision immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry assay, accurately diagnoses brain amyloidosis in both cognitively unimpaired and impaired research participants .
