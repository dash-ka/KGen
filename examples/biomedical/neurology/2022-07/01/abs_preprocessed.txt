global research studies using samples
to determine the diagnostic accuracy of a plasma amyloidbeta 4240 assay in classifying amyloid pet status across global research studies collected by multiple centers
multiple centers that utilize different blood collection
multiple centers that utilize processing protocols
methods plasma samples were obtained from 3 large alzheimer disease research cohorts in sweden
methods plasma samples were obtained from 3 large alzheimer disease research cohorts in the united states
methods plasma samples were obtained from 3 large alzheimer disease research cohorts in australia
plasma amyloidbeta 4240 was measured by a high precision immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry assay and compared to the reference standards of amyloid pet 4240
plasma amyloidbeta 4240 was measured by a high precision immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry assay and compared to the reference standards of csf amyloidbeta 4240
in the combined cohort of 465 participants plasma amyloidbeta 4240 halzheimer disease good concordance with amyloid pet status
concordance improved with the inclusion of apoe epsilon4 carrier status
the auc of plasma amyloidbeta 4240 with csf amyloid status was 085
the auc of plasma amyloidbeta 4240 with csf amyloid status improved to 093 with apoe epsilon4 status
the auc of plasma amyloidbeta 4240 with csf amyloid status were consistent across the 3 cohorts despite differences in protocols
a high precision immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry assay performed impaired individuals
a high precision immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry assay performed unimpaired individuals
a high precision immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry assay performed similarly in individuals
populations enrolled in clinical trials
populations enrolled in alzheimer disease research
plasma amyloidbeta 4240 can be utilized to aid in the diagnosis of 4240 halzheimer disease
plasma amyloidbeta 4240 can be utilized to identify those at risk for future dementia due to 4240 halzheimer disease
plasma amyloidbeta 4240 can be utilized to improve the diversity of populations
plasma amyloidbeta 4240 is a robust measure for detecting amyloid plaques
