Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis as a part of the thrombosis and thrombocytopenia syndrome is a rare adverse drug reaction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 vaccination . Estimated background rate of Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia is 0.1 per million per month . We assessed the age-stratified risk of Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with and without thrombocytopenia after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 vaccination .

We estimated the absolute risk of Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with and without thrombocytopenia within 28 days of a first dose of 4 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 vaccinations using data from the European Medicines Agency EudraVigilance database . As a denominator, we used data on vaccine delivery from 31 European countries . For 22.8 million adults from 25 countries, we estimated the absolute risk of Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 per age category .

The absolute risk of Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis within 28 days of first-dose vaccination was 7.5, 0.7, 0.6, and 0.6 per million of first doses of ChAdOx1 nCov-19, Ad26.COV2.S, BNT162b2, and mRNA-1273, respectively . The absolute risk of Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia within 28 days of first dose vaccination was 4.4, 0.7, 0.0, and 0.0 per million of first doses of ChAdOx1 nCov-19, Ad26.COV2.S, BNT162b2, and mRNA-1273, respectively . In recipients of ChAdOx1 nCov-19, the absolute risk of Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, both with and without thrombocytopenia, was the highest in the 18- to 24-year-old group . The risk of Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia in ChAdOx1 nCov-19 recipients was the lowest in the age group above 70 years . Age lower than 60 years compared to above 60 years was a predictor for Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia .

The risk of Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia within 28 days of first-dose vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 was higher in younger age groups . The risk of Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia was slightly increased in patients receiving Ad26.COV2.S compared with the estimated background risk . The risk of Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia was not increased in recipients of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 mRNA vaccines .
