to investigate the effect of age at pediatric arterial ischemic stroke on longterm cognitive outcome in order to identify patients particularly at risk for the development of longterm cognitive sequelae
this crosssectional study included patients in the chronic phase of stroke previously diagnosed with childhood arterial ischemic stroke
this crosssectional study included patients in the chronic phase of stroke previously diagnosed with the pediatric stroke group
this crosssectional study included patients in the chronic phase of stroke previously diagnosed with neonatal
participants with severe learning difficulties hindering the cognitive assessment were excluded
participants with active epilepsy hindering the cognitive assessment were excluded
participants with behavioral problems hindering the cognitive assessment were excluded
intelligence executive functions processing visualmotor skills were assessed with neuropsychological tests
several cognitive domains  executive functions processing letter fluency were assessed with neuropsychological tests
intelligence executive functions processing memory were assessed with neuropsychological tests
several cognitive domains  executive functions processing memory were assessed with neuropsychological tests
several cognitive domains  executive functions processing visualmotor skills were assessed with neuropsychological tests
intelligence executive functions processing speed were assessed with neuropsychological tests
intelligence executive functions processing letter fluency were assessed with neuropsychological tests
several cognitive domains  executive functions processing speed were assessed with neuropsychological tests
cognitive longterm outcome was compared across patients after early childhood stroke
cognitive longterm outcome was compared across patients after neonatal stroke
cognitive longterm outcome was compared across patients after late childhood stroke
fiftytwo patients after childhood arterial ischemic stroke met the inclusion criteria
fiftytwo patients after 49 healthy controls met the inclusion criteria
fiftytwo patients after neonatal met the inclusion criteria
cognitive outcome was significantly worse in the pediatric stroke group compared to the pediatric stroke group
a nonlinear effect of age at stroke was found for verbal learning with early childhood stroke showing significantly worse cognitive outcome compared to late childhood stroke
a nonlinear effect of age at stroke was found for verbal learning with early childhood stroke showing significantly worse cognitive outcome compared to neonatal childhood stroke
a nonlinear effect of age at stroke was found for cognitive flexibility
a nonlinear effect of age at stroke was found for processing speed
age at stroke is an important factor for poststroke recovery
age at stroke modulates longterm cognitive outcome irrespective of lesion location
age at stroke modulates longterm cognitive outcome irrespective of lesion size
children after early childhood stroke are at particular risk for longterm alterations in cognitive functions
