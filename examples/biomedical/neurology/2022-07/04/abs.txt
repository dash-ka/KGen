To investigate the effect of age at pediatric arterial ischemic stroke on long-term cognitive outcome in order to identify patients particularly at risk for the development of long-term cognitive sequelae .

This cross-sectional study included patients in the chronic phase of stroke previously diagnosed with neonatal or childhood arterial ischemic stroke and a control group . Participants with active epilepsy, severe learning difficulties, or behavioral problems hindering the cognitive assessment were excluded . Several cognitive domains, including intelligence, executive functions, processing speed, memory, letter fluency, and visual-motor skills were assessed with neuropsychological tests . Cognitive long-term outcome was compared across patients after neonatal stroke, early childhood stroke, and late childhood stroke .

Fifty-two patients after neonatal or childhood arterial ischemic stroke and 49 healthy controls met the inclusion criteria . Cognitive outcome was significantly worse in the pediatric stroke group compared to the control group . A nonlinear effect of age at stroke was found for cognitive flexibility, processing speed, and verbal learning with early childhood stroke, showing significantly worse cognitive outcome compared to neonatal or late childhood stroke .

Age at stroke is an important factor for poststroke recovery and modulates long-term cognitive outcome irrespective of lesion size and lesion location . Children after early childhood stroke are at particular risk for long-term alterations in cognitive functions .
