The restoration of touch to fingers and fingertips is critical to achieving dexterous neuroprosthetic control for individuals with sensorimotor dysfunction . However, localized fingertip sensations have not been evoked via intracortical microstimulation .

Using a novel intraoperative mapping approach, we implanted electrode arrays in the finger areas of left and right somatosensory cortex and delivered intracortical microstimulation over a 2-year period in a human participant with spinal cord injury .

Stimulation evoked tactile sensations in 8 fingers, including fingertips, spanning both hands . Evoked percepts followed expected somatotopic arrangements . The subject was able to reliably identify up to 7 finger-specific sites spanning both hands in a finger discrimination task . The size of the evoked percepts was on average 33 percent larger than a finger pad, as assessed via manual markings of a hand image . The size of the evoked percepts increased modestly with increased stimulation intensity, growing 21 percent as pulse amplitude increased from 20 µA to 80 µA. Detection thresholds were estimated on a subset of electrodes, with estimates of 9.2 µA to 35 µA observed, roughly consistent with prior studies .

These results suggest that intracortical microstimulation can enable the delivery of consistent and localized fingertip sensations during object manipulation by neuroprostheses for individuals with somatosensory deficits .
