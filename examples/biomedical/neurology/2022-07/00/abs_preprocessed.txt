however localized fingertip sensations have not been evoked via intracortical microstimulation
using a novel intraoperative mapping approach we delivered intracortical microstimulation over a 2year period in a human participant with spinal cord injury
using a novel intraoperative mapping approach we implanted electrode arrays in the finger areas of left somatosensory cortex
using a novel intraoperative mapping approach we implanted electrode arrays in the finger areas of right somatosensory cortex
fingertips spanning both hands
stimulation evoked tactile sensations in 8 fingers including fingertips
evoked percepts followed expected somatotopic arrangements
7 fingerspecific sites spanning both hands in a finger discrimination task
the subject was able to reliably identify up to 7 fingerspecific sites
the evoked percepts
the size of the was on average 33 percent larger than a finger pad as assessed via manual markings of a hand image
pulse amplitude increased from 20 ua to 80 ua
the evoked percepts
the size of the increased modestly with increased stimulation intensity growing 21 percent as pulse amplitude
detection thresholds were estimated on a subset of electrodes with estimates of 92 ua to 35 ua roughly consistent with prior studies
35 ua observed
these results suggest that intracortical microstimulation can enable the delivery of consistent fingertip sensations during object manipulation by neuroprostheses for individuals with somatosensory deficits
