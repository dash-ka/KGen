cardiovascular risk factors have been implicated in the etiology of cerebral small vessel disease however whether the associations are causal remains unclear in part due to the susceptibility of observational studies to reverse causation
cardiovascular risk factors have been implicated in the etiology of cerebral small vessel disease however whether the associations are causal remains unclear in part due to the susceptibility of observational studies to reverse confounding
here we use mendelian randomization to determine which cardiovascular risk factors are likely to be involved in the etiology of cerebral small vessel disease
we used data from largescale genomewide association studies of european ancestry to identify genetic proxies for type 2 diabetes
we used data from largescale genomewide association studies of european ancestry to identify genetic proxies for smoking initiation
we used data from largescale genomewide association studies of european ancestry to identify genetic proxies for cigarettes per day
we used data from largescale genomewide association studies of european ancestry to identify genetic proxies for blood pressure
we used data from largescale genomewide association studies of european ancestry to identify genetic proxies for blood lipids
we used data from largescale genomewide association studies of european ancestry to identify genetic proxies for body mass index
we used data from largescale genomewide association studies of european ancestry to identify genetic proxies for alcohol consumption
mendelian randomization was performed to assess cigarettes per day association with 3 neuroimaging features
3 neuroimaging features that are altered in cerebral small vessel disease
cerebral small vessel disease using genetic summary data from the uk biobank
validation using mregger
validation using a pleiotropyminimizing approach
validation using weighted median
our primary analysis used inverseweighted median mendelian randomization with validation
finally multivariable mendelian randomization was performed to study the effects of multiple risk factors jointly
mendelian randomization analysis showed consistent associations across all methods for higher genetically proxied systolic blood pressures with md
mendelian randomization analysis showed consistent associations across all methods for higher genetically proxied systolic blood pressures with wmh
mendelian randomization analysis showed consistent associations across all methods for higher genetically proxied systolic blood pressures with fa
mendelian randomization analysis showed consistent associations across all methods for higher genetically proxied body mass index with wmh
mendelian randomization analysis showed consistent associations across all methods for higher genetically proxied diastolic blood pressures with fa
mendelian randomization analysis showed consistent associations across all methods for higher genetically proxied diastolic blood pressures with md
mendelian randomization analysis showed consistent associations across all methods for higher genetically proxied diastolic blood pressures with wmh
all validation methods used
there was weaker evidence for associations between total cholesterol
there was weaker evidence for at least 1 cerebral small vessel disease imaging feature
associations between total cholesterol were not reproducible across all validation methods
there was weaker evidence for associations between type 2 diabetes liability
there was weaker evidence for associations between smoking initiation
there was weaker evidence for associations between pulse pressure
associations between lowdensity lipoprotein were not reproducible across all validation methods
associations between smoking initiation were not reproducible across all validation methods
associations between type 2 diabetes liability were not reproducible across all validation methods
associations between at least 1 cerebral small vessel disease imaging feature were not reproducible across all validation methods
there was weaker evidence for associations between lowdensity lipoprotein
associations between pulse pressure were not reproducible across all validation methods
multivariable mendelian randomization analysis for blood pressure traits found that the effect was primarily through genetically proxied diastolic blood pressure across all cerebral small vessel disease traits
genetic predisposition to higher body mass index is associated with a higher burden of cerebral small vessel disease suggesting a causal role
genetic predisposition to higher blood pressure primarily diastolic blood pressure is associated with a higher burden of cerebral small vessel disease suggesting a causal role
improved management of these risk factors could reduce the burden of cerebral small vessel disease
improved treatment of these risk factors could reduce the burden of cerebral small vessel disease
