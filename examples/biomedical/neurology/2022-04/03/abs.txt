The neurologic deficits of neonatal post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus have been linked to periventricular white matter injury . To improve understanding of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus-related injury, diffusion basis spectrum imaging was applied in neonates, modeling axonal and myelin integrity, fiber density, and extrafiber pathologies . Objectives included characterizing diffusion basis spectrum imaging measures in periventricular tracts, associating measures with ventricular size, and examining MRI findings in the context of postmortem white matter histology from similar cases .

A prospective cohort of infants born very preterm underwent term equivalent MRI, including infants with post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, high-grade intraventricular hemorrhage without hydrocephalus , and controls . diffusion basis spectrum imaging metrics extracted from the corpus callosum, corticospinal tracts, and optic radiations included fiber axial diffusivity, fiber radial diffusivity, fiber fractional anisotropy, fiber fraction, restricted fractions, and nonrestricted fractions . Measures were compared across groups and correlated with ventricular size . Corpus callosum postmortem immunohistochemistry in infants with and without post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus assessed intrafiber and extrafiber pathologies .



post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus was associated with diffuse white matter injury, including tract-specific patterns of axonal and myelin injury, fiber loss, cellular infiltration, and inflammation . Larger ventricular size was associated with greater disruption . Postmortem immunohistochemistry confirmed MRI findings . These results demonstrate diffusion basis spectrum imaging provides an innovative approach extending beyond conventional diffusion MRI for investigating neuropathologic effects of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus on neonatal brain development .
