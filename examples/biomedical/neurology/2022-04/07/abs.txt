In high-pollution areas, physical activity may have a paradoxical effect on brain health by increasing particulate deposition in the lungs . We examined whether physical activity modifies associations of Air Pollution (AP) with brain volumes in an epidemiologic framework .

Wrist accelerometers, multimodal MRI with T1 images and T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery data, and land use regression were used to estimate vigorous physical activity, structural brain volumes, and AP, respectively, in subsets of the full sample . We evaluated associations among AP interquartile ranges, vigorous physical activity, and brain structure volumes and assessed interactions between AP and vigorous physical activity .

vigorous physical activity was positively associated with Gray Matter Volume (GMV) and negatively associated with White Matter Hyperintensity Volume (WMHV). While NO2, PM2.5absorbance, and PM2.5 were negatively associated with GMV. NO2 and PM2.5absorbance interacted with vigorous physical activity on WMHV . Associations between these air pollutants and WMHV were stronger among participants with high vigorous physical activity . Similarly, vigorous physical activity was negatively associated with WMHV for those in areas of low NO2 and PM2.5absorbance but was null among those living in areas of high NO2 and PM2.5absorbance .

Physical activity is associated with beneficial brain outcomes, while AP is associated with detrimental brain outcomes . vigorous physical activity may exacerbate associations of AP with white matter hyperintensity lesions, and AP may attenuate the beneficial associations of physical activity with these lesions .
