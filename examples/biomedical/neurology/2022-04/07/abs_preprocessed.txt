in highpollution areas physical activity may have a paradoxical effect on brain health by increasing particulate deposition in the lungs
we examined whether physical activity modifies associations of air pollution with brain volumes in an epidemiologic framework
wrist accelerometers multimodal mri with t2 fluidattenuated inversion recovery data use regression were used to estimate vigorous physical activity structural brain volumes and air pollution respectively in subsets of the full sample
wrist accelerometers multimodal mri with t1 images use regression were used to estimate vigorous physical activity structural brain volumes and air pollution respectively in subsets of the full sample
land use regression were used to estimate vigorous physical activity structural brain volumes and air pollution respectively in subsets of the full sample
we assessed interactions between vigorous physical activity
we evaluated associations among air pollution interquartile ranges
we assessed interactions between air pollution
we evaluated associations among vigorous physical activity
we evaluated associations among brain structure volumes
vigorous physical activity was positively negatively associated with white matter hyperintensity volume
vigorous physical activity was positively associated with gray matter volume
while no2 pm2 5 absorbance were negatively associated with gray matter volume
while no2 pm2 5 were negatively associated with gray matter volume
pm2 5 absorbance interacted with vigorous physical activity on white matter hyperintensity volume
no2 interacted with vigorous physical activity on white matter hyperintensity volume
associations between these air pollutants were stronger among participants with high vigorous physical activity
associations between white matter hyperintensity volume were stronger among participants with high vigorous physical activity
those living in areas of high no2
similarly vigorous physical activity was negatively associated with white matter hyperintensity volume for those in areas of low no2
similarly vigorous physical activity was negatively associated with white matter hyperintensity volume for those in areas of pm2 5 absorbance
similarly vigorous physical activity was null among those
those living in areas of pm2 5 absorbance
physical activity is associated with beneficial brain outcomes while air pollution is associated with detrimental brain outcomes
air pollution may attenuate the beneficial associations of physical activity with white matter hyperintensity lesions
vigorous physical activity may exacerbate associations of air pollution with white matter hyperintensity lesions
