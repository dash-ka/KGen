a pediatric neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene
duchenne muscular dystrophy is a pediatric neuromuscular disorder
there are few data on the young glucocorticoidnaive duchenne muscular dystrophy population
genotypephenotype associations have been examined in glucocorticoidtreated boys
a sample of young glucocorticoidnaive duchenne muscular dystrophy boys is described
genotypephenotype associations are investigated
doubleblind clinical trial comparing 3 glucocorticoid regimens
the finding the optimum corticosteroid regime for duchenne muscular dystrophy study an international multicenter randomized doubleblind clinical trial in glucocorticoidnaive genetically confirmed boys with duchenne muscular dystrophy between 8 years of age
screening data were collected for all the participants in the
baseline data were collected for all the participants in the
the finding the optimum corticosteroid regime for duchenne muscular dystrophy study an international multicenter randomized doubleblind clinical trial in glucocorticoidnaive genetically confirmed boys with duchenne muscular dystrophy between 4 years of age
duchenne muscular dystrophy study describes genetic characteristics of a sample of young glucocorticoidnaive boys with duchenne muscular dystrophy
duchenne muscular dystrophy study describes clinical characteristics of a sample of young glucocorticoidnaive boys with duchenne muscular dystrophy
a low threshold for creatine kinase testing can lead to an earlier diagnosis
speech delays were common presenting symptoms
motor delays were common presenting symptoms
the effects of low pretreatment height on growth height require further study
the effects of low pretreatment height on adult height require further study
these findings may inform study design for future clinical trials
these findings may promote earlier recognition of duchenne muscular dystrophy
