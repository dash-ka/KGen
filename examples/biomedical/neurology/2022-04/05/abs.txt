Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a pediatric neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene . Genotype-phenotype associations have been examined in glucocorticoid-treated boys, but there are few data on the young glucocorticoid-naive DMD population . A sample of young glucocorticoid-naive DMD boys is described, and genotype-phenotype associations are investigated .

Screening and baseline data were collected for all the participants in the Finding the Optimum Corticosteroid Regime for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy study, an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial comparing 3 glucocorticoid regimens in glucocorticoid-naive, genetically confirmed boys with DMD between 4 and 8 years of age .


This study describes clinical and genetic characteristics of a sample of young glucocorticoid-naive boys with DMD. A low threshold for creatine kinase testing can lead to an earlier diagnosis . Motor and speech delays were common presenting symptoms . The effects of low pretreatment height on growth and adult height require further study . These findings may promote earlier recognition of DMD and inform study design for future clinical trials .
