robust cerebrovascular collaterals in adult patients with large vessel occlusion stroke improved outcomes
robust cerebrovascular collaterals in adult patients with large vessel occlusion stroke have been associated with longer treatment windows better recanalization rates
the role of collaterals in pediatric stroke is not known
the primary aim was to determine whether favorable collaterals correlated with better radiographic in children with ischemic stroke
the primary aim was to determine whether favorable collaterals correlated with clinical outcomes in children with ischemic stroke
ischemic stroke who underwent thrombectomy
stroke who underwent thrombectomy between 2018 at 27 us centers
stroke who underwent thrombectomy between 2000 at 27 european centers
children enrolled in savechilds a retrospective multicenter observational cohort study of 73 pediatric patients with stroke
the primary aim analyzed a subset of children
stroke who underwent thrombectomy between 2018 at 27 european centers
stroke who underwent thrombectomy between 2000 at 27 us centers
angiographic imaging and followup modified rankin scale scores available for review
included patients had baseline angiographic imaging and followup
posterior circulation occlusions were excluded
less than 50 percent filling distal to the occluded vessel
score in which favorable collaterals are defined as over 50 percent filling as less than 50 percent
cerebrovascular collaterals were graded on acute neuroimaging by 2 blinded neuroradiologists according to the tan collateral score
score in which favorable collaterals are defined as over unfavorable collaterals as less than 50 percent
collateral status was correlated with outcomes
collateral status was correlated with neuroimaging characteristics
collateral status was correlated with clinical characteristics
betweengroup comparisons were performed with the wilcoxon ranksum test for continuous variables
betweengroup comparisons were performed with fisher exact test for binary variables
favorable collaterals were associated with better clinical outcome in the primary aim
favorable collaterals were associated with slower early infarct growth rate
favorable collaterals were associated with smaller final stroke burden
prospective studies are needed to determine the impact of collaterals in childhood stroke
the primary aim provides class ii evidence that in children with ischemic stroke favorable collaterals were associated with better clinical outcomes
children with ischemic stroke undergoing thrombectomy
the primary aim provides class ii evidence that in children with ischemic stroke favorable collaterals were associated with improved radiographic outcomes
