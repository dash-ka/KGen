To examine risks of stroke recurrence and mortality after first and recurrent stroke .

Using Danish nationwide health registries, we included patients age older than 18 years with first-time ischemic stroke  or intracerebral hemorrhage from 2004 to 2018 . Accounting for the competing risk of death, absolute risks of stroke recurrence were computed separately for each stroke subtype and within strata of age groups, sex, stroke severity, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, Essen stroke risk score, and atrial fibrillation . Mortality risks were computed after first and recurrent stroke .

After adjusting for competing risks, the overall 1-year and 10-year risks of recurrence were 4 percent and 13 percent following first-time ischemic stroke and 3 percent and 12 percent following first-time intracerebral hemorrhage . For ischemic stroke, the risk of recurrence increased with age and was higher for men and following mild vs more severe stroke . The most marked differences were across Essen risk scores, for whintracerebral hemorrhage recurrence risks increased with increasing scores . For intracerebral hemorrhage, risks were similar for both sexes and did not increase with Essen risk score . For ischemic stroke, the 1-year and 10-year risks of all-cause mortality were 17 percent and 56 percent after a first-time stroke and 25 percent and 70 percent after a recurrent stroke. Corresponding estimates for intracerebral hemorrhage were 37 percent and 70 percent after a first-time event and 31 percent and 75 percent after a recurrent event .

The risk of stroke recurrence was substantial following both subtypes, but risks differed markedly among patient subgroups . The risk of mortality was higher after a recurrent than first-time stroke .
