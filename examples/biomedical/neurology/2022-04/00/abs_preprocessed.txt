to examine risks of stroke recurrence and mortality after first stroke
to examine risks of stroke recurrence and mortality after recurrent stroke
using danish nationwide health registries we included patients age older than 18 years with firsttime ischemic stroke from 2004 to 2018
using danish nationwide health registries we included patients age older than 18 years with intracerebral hemorrhage from 2004 to 2018
accounting for the competing risk of death absolute risks of stroke recurrence were computed separately within strata of essen stroke risk score
accounting for the competing risk of death absolute risks of stroke recurrence were computed separately within strata of alcohol use
accounting for the competing risk of death absolute risks of stroke recurrence were computed separately within strata of sex
accounting for the competing risk of death absolute risks of stroke recurrence were computed separately within strata of body mass index
accounting for the competing risk of death absolute risks of stroke recurrence were computed separately within strata of smoking
accounting for the competing risk of death absolute risks of stroke recurrence were computed separately within strata of age groups
accounting for the competing risk of death absolute risks of stroke recurrence were computed separately within strata of stroke severity
accounting for the competing risk of death absolute risks of stroke recurrence were computed separately within strata of atrial fibrillation
accounting for the competing risk of death absolute risks of stroke recurrence were computed separately for each stroke subtype
mortality risks were computed after first stroke
mortality risks were computed after recurrent stroke
after adjusting for competing risks the overall 1year risks of recurrence were 4 percent and 13 percent following firsttime ischemic stroke and 12 percent following firsttime intracerebral hemorrhage
after adjusting for competing risks the overall 10year risks of recurrence were 4 percent and 13 percent following 3 percent and 12 percent following firsttime intracerebral hemorrhage
after adjusting for competing risks the overall 1year risks of recurrence were 4 percent and 13 percent following 3 percent and 12 percent following firsttime intracerebral hemorrhage
after adjusting for competing risks the overall 10year risks of recurrence were 4 percent and 13 percent following firsttime ischemic stroke and 12 percent following firsttime intracerebral hemorrhage
for ischemic stroke the risk of recurrence following mild
for ischemic stroke the risk of recurrence was higher for men
for ischemic stroke the risk of recurrence following more severe stroke
for ischemic stroke the risk of recurrence increased with age
the most marked differences were across essen risk scores for whintracerebral hemorrhage recurrence risks
whintracerebral hemorrhage recurrence risks increased with increasing scores
for intracerebral hemorrhage risks did not increase with essen risk score
for intracerebral hemorrhage risks were similar for both sexes
for ischemic stroke the 1year risks of allbecause mortality were 56 percent after 70 percent after a recurrent stroke
for ischemic stroke the 1year risks of allbecause mortality were 17 percent after 70 percent after a recurrent stroke
for ischemic stroke the 10year risks of allbecause mortality were 17 percent after 25 percent
for ischemic stroke the 1year risks of allbecause mortality were 17 percent after a firsttime stroke
for ischemic stroke the 1year risks of allbecause mortality were 56 percent after 25 percent
for ischemic stroke the 1year risks of allbecause mortality were 17 percent after 25 percent
for ischemic stroke the 10year risks of allbecause mortality were 56 percent after 25 percent
for ischemic stroke the 10year risks of allbecause mortality were 17 percent after 70 percent after a recurrent stroke
for ischemic stroke the 10year risks of allbecause mortality were 56 percent after a firsttime stroke

for ischemic stroke the 10year risks of allbecause mortality were 17 percent after a firsttime stroke
for ischemic stroke the 1year risks of allbecause mortality were 56 percent after a firsttime stroke
corresponding estimates for intracerebral hemorrhage were 70 percent after 31 percent
corresponding estimates for intracerebral hemorrhage were 70 percent after 75 percent after a recurrent event
corresponding estimates for intracerebral hemorrhage were 37 percent after 31 percent
corresponding estimates for intracerebral hemorrhage were 37 percent after a firsttime event
corresponding estimates for intracerebral hemorrhage were 37 percent after 75 percent after a recurrent event
corresponding estimates for intracerebral hemorrhage were 70 percent after a firsttime event
the risk of stroke recurrence was substantial following both subtypes
risks differed markedly among patient subgroups
the risk of mortality was higher after a recurrent than firsttime stroke
