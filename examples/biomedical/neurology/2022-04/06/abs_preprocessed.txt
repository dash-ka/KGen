within this continuum of presentations the presence of behavioral symptoms in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been consistently reported although it is unclear whether this is to be considered a natural evolution of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
within this continuum of presentations the presence of mild cognitive in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been consistently reported although it is unclear whether this is to be considered a natural evolution of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
within this continuum of presentations the presence of mild cognitive in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been consistently reported although it is unclear whether this is to be considered a distinct phenotype

patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were classified according to the revised strong criteria into 8 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia
patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were classified according to the revised strong criteria into 21 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with behavioral involvement
patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were classified according to the revised strong criteria into 54 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with only motor deficits
patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were classified according to the revised strong criteria into 21 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with cognitive involvement
first we assessed the structural connectivity patterns across the amyotrophic lateral sclerosissclerosisfrontotemporal dementia spectrum
first we assessed the functional connectivity patterns across the amyotrophic lateral sclerosissclerosisfrontotemporal dementia spectrum
second we investigated whether connectivity alterations of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with any degree of cognitive impairment resembled more the pattern of damage of one
second we investigated where mri connectivity alterations of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with any degree of cognitive impairment resembled more the pattern of the other end of the spectrum
second we investigated whether connectivity alterations of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with any degree of cognitive impairment resembled more the pattern of the other end of the spectrum
more the pattern of the other end of the spectrum moving from grouplevel to singlesubject analysis

amyotrophic lateral sclerosiscibi patients decreased functional connectivity within the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementialike pattern
amyotrophic lateral sclerosiscibi patients demonstrated an amyotrophic lateral sclerosiscnlike pattern of structural damage diverging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosiscn with similar motor impairment for the presence of enhanced functional connectivity within sensorimotor areas
