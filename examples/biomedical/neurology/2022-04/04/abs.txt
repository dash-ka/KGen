To determine whether rituximab is safe and potentially beneficial, warranting further investigation in an efficacy trial for acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis .




Although rituximab was safe and well-tolerated, these results suggest that there is a low probability of observing the defined clinically meaningful steroid-sparing effect over a 12-month period in a phase 3 trial of mild to moderately symptomatic acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis .

This study provides Class I evidence that for mild to moderate acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis, compared with placebo, rituximab is safe but unlikely to reduce steroid use by an absolute difference of at least 30 percent at 1 year .
