mild to moderate acetylcholine receptor antibodypositive generalized myasthenia gravis compared with placebo
this study provides class i evidence that for mild to moderate acetylcholine receptor antibodypositive rituximab is unlikely to reduce steroid use by an absolute difference of at least 30 percent at 1 year
