a progressive disease that has been linked with cognitive impairment and dementia in the elderly
a progressive disease that develops as early as childhood
carotid intimamedia thickness is a measurement of a progressive disease
carotid intimamedia thickness is a measurement of atherosclerosis
however the relationship between the race remain unclear
however the relationship between social disparities in this relationship remain unclear
however the relationship between carotid intimamedia thickness remain unclear
however the relationship between midlife cognitive function remain unclear
we examined the association between carotid intimamedia thickness among white participants from a semirural communitybased cohort in bogalusa louisiana
we examined the association between carotid intimamedia thickness among black participants from a semirural communitybased cohort in bogalusa louisiana
we examined cognitive function in midlife among white participants from a semirural communitybased cohort in bogalusa louisiana
we examined cognitive function in midlife among black participants from a semirural communitybased cohort in bogalusa louisiana
in this crosssectional analysis of participants from louisiana heart study linear regression models were used to determine the association between carotid intimamedia thickness an individual cognitive domainbased z scores
carotid intimamedia thickness dichotomized above the 50th percentile
in this crosssectional analysis of participants from the bogalusa  linear regression models were used to determine the association between carotid intimamedia thickness an individual cognitive domainbased z scores
in this crosssectional analysis of participants from louisiana heart study linear regression models were used to determine the association between carotid intimamedia thickness an a demographically standardized global cognitive score z scores
in this crosssectional analysis of participants from the bogalusa  linear regression models were used to determine the association between carotid intimamedia thickness an a demographically standardized global cognitive score z scores
stratified analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of race
stratified analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of the individual education status
having a carotid intimamedia thickness above the 50th percentile was inversely associated with global cognitive score independently of cardiovascular risk factors
having a carotid intimamedia thickness above the 50th percentile achieved education
the effect remained significant in white participants for education
the effect remained significant in black participants for education
the effect remained significant in black participants after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors
the effect remained significant in white participants after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors
the interaction between carotid intimamedia thickness   50th percentile and education was significant analysis showed an association with global cognitive score among those with lower
the interaction between carotid intimamedia thickness   50th percentile and education was stratified analysis showed an association with global cognitive score among those with lower
lower achieved education independently of major cardiovascular risk factors
subclinical atherosclerosis measured as carotid intimamedia thickness
subclinical atherosclerosis was associated with worse midlife cognitive function independently of major cardiovascular risk factors
an association may be stronger among black than white participants likely due to corresponding structural
an association was buffered by education
an association may be stronger among black than white participants likely due to social determinants
these findings suggest subclinical atherosclerosis as a potential target to prevent cognitive decline
these findings underscore the importance of establishing preventive measures in midlife
