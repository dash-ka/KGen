parkinson disease who are at risk for ongoing cognitive decline
several clinical have been proposed to identify individuals with parkinson disease
neuroimaging biomarkers have been proposed to identify individuals with parkinson disease
this study newly diagnosed parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment
this study aimed to explore whether white matter connectivity disruption is associated with dementia conversion in patients with
seventyfive patients with drugnaive parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment were enrolled for the neuroimaging analyses
mild cognitive impairment who underwent serial cognitive assessments during the followup period
mild cognitive impairment who underwent serial cognitive assessments during the followup period
mild cognitive impairment who underwent serial cognitive assessments during the followup period
seventyfive patients with drugnaive parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment were classified into either the parkinson disease with lowrisk group depending on whether seventyfive patients with drugnaive parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment converted to dementia within 5 years of parkinson disease diagnosis
seventyfive patients with drugnaive parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment were classified into either the parkinson disease with dementia highrisk group depending on whether seventyfive patients with drugnaive parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment converted to dementia within 5 years of parkinson disease diagnosis
we conducted degreebased statistic analyses based on a graphtheoretical concept to identify the subnetworks whose white matter connectivity was disrupted in dementia highrisk group compared with the highrisk group
this study aimed to explore whether white matter connectivity disruption is associated with dementia conversion in patients with demonstrated that disrupted white matter connectivity in posterior cortical regions
this study which correlated with frontal dysfunction is associated with early dementia conversion in parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment
this study which correlated with executive dysfunction is associated with early dementia conversion in parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment
this study aimed to explore whether white matter connectivity disruption is associated with dementia conversion in patients with demonstrated that disrupted white matter connectivity in frontal cortical regions
