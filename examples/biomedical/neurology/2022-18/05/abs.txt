Several clinical and neuroimaging biomarkers have been proposed to identify individuals with Parkinson disease who are at risk for ongoing cognitive decline . This study aimed to explore whether white matter connectivity disruption is associated with dementia conversion in patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment .

Seventy-five patients with drug-naive Parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment who underwent serial cognitive assessments during the follow-up period were enrolled for the neuroimaging analyses . The patients were classified into either the Parkinson disease with dementia high-risk group or low-risk group, depending on whether they converted to dementia within 5 years of Parkinson disease diagnosis . We conducted degree-based statistic analyses based on a graph-theoretical concept to identify the subnetworks whose white matter connectivity was disrupted in the low-risk group compared with the high-risk group .


This study demonstrated that disrupted white matter connectivity in frontal and posterior cortical regions, which correlated with frontal and executive dysfunction, is associated with early dementia conversion in Parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment .
