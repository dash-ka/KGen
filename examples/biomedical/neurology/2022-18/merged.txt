this was a prospective observational study of all patients
adults with a firstever unprovoked seizure from sleep were consecutively recruited
all patients were followed up at least once after a firstever seizure
those not requiring regular clinical review were contacted every 1 to 2 years
potential predictors of future awake seizures were analyzed
the timing and pattern of subsequent seizures were analyzed
two hundred thirtynine adults with a firstever unprovoked seizure from sleep were identified
130 patients had 130 patients second seizure from sleep
the 174 patients who had recurrent seizures
of the 174 patients
of 130 patients 76 of 94 also had 130 patients third seizure from sleep
eightynine patients developed awake seizures during followup
in half of these patients their third seizure from sleep occurred within 2 years of a firstever seizure
the risk of an awake seizure within 1 year of a firstever seizure from sleep was 139 percent
139 percent falling to 2 percent to 53 percent per year after 3 years
the risks of an awake seizure within 1 year of a third consecutive sleep seizure were 87 percent respectively
the risks of an awake seizure within 1 year of a second consecutive sleep seizure were 87 percent respectively
the risks of an awake seizure within 1 year of a second consecutive sleep seizure were 99 percent respectively
the risks of an awake seizure within 1 year of a third consecutive sleep seizure were 99 percent respectively
similarly decreased with time
most initial seizure recurrences after a firstever sleep seizure occur during sleep
while more than onethird eventually had awake seizures the annual risk of an awake seizure was below 14 percent
while more than onethird eventually had awake seizures the annual risk of an awake seizure was decreased with time albeit with a small ongoing risk of between 2 percent
while more than onethird eventually had awake seizures the annual risk of an awake seizure was decreased with time albeit with 5 percent per year
