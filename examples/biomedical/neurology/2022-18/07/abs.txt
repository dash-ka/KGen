Eyelid myoclonia with absences is a generalized epilepsy syndrome with a prognosis and clinical characteristics that are still partially undefined . We investigated electroclinical endophenotypes and long-term seizure outcome in a large cohort of patients with Eyelid myoclonia with absences .

In this multicenter retrospective study, patients with Eyelid myoclonia with absences with over 5 years of follow-up were included . We investigated prognostic patterns and sustained terminal remission, along with their prognostic factors . Moreover, a 2-step cluster analysis was used to investigate the presence of distinct Eyelid myoclonia with absences endophenotypes .


Early epilepsy onset was the most relevant prognostic factor for poor treatment response . A long latency between epilepsy onset and ASM response was observed, suggesting the effect of age-related brain changes in Eyelid myoclonia with absences remission . Last, our cluster analysis showed a clear-cut distinction of patients with Eyelid myoclonia with absences into an Eyelid myoclonia with absences-plus insidious subphenotype and an Eyelid myoclonia with absences-only benign cluster that strongly differed in terms of remission rates and cognitive outcomes .
