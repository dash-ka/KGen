a generalized epilepsy syndrome with clinical characteristics
a generalized epilepsy syndrome with a prognosis
eyelid myoclonia with absences is a
clinical characteristics that are still partially undefined
we investigated electroclinical endophenotypes in a large cohort of patients with eyelid myoclonia with absences
we investigated longterm seizure outcome in a large cohort of patients with eyelid myoclonia with absences
in this multicenter retrospective study patients with eyelid myoclonia with absences with over 5 years of followup were included
we investigated prognostic patterns
we investigated sustained terminal remission along with prognostic patterns prognostic factors
moreover a 2step cluster analysis was used to investigate the presence of distinct eyelid myoclonia with absences endophenotypes
early epilepsy onset was the most relevant prognostic factor for poor treatment response
a long latency between epilepsy onset was observed suggesting the effect of agerelated brain changes in eyelid myoclonia with absences remission
a long latency between asm response was observed suggesting the effect of agerelated brain changes in eyelid myoclonia with absences remission
an eyelid myoclonia with absencesonly benign cluster that strongly differed in terms of cognitive outcomes
