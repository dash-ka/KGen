the multiple sclerosis populations survival from cancer cancer is compromised
the multiple sclerosis populations survival from colorectal cancer is compromised
timely diagnoses affect cancer survival
timely diagnoses have not been studied in the multiple sclerosis cancer population
cancer screening have not been studied in the multiple sclerosis cancer population
cancer screening affect cancer survival
we investigated whether cancer stage differed in patients with cancer with and without multiple sclerosis
we investigated whether the diagnostic route differed in patients with cancer with and without multiple sclerosis
we investigated whether diagnostic interval differed in patients with cancer with and without multiple sclerosis
we conducted a matched populationbased crosssectional study of colorectal cancers in patients with multiple sclerosis from ontario canada using administrative data
we conducted a matched populationbased crosssectional study of breast cancers in patients with multiple sclerosis from ontario canada using administrative data
exclusion criteria included no health care coverage without those with any demyelinating disease
exclusion criteria included concurrent primary cancers  without multiple sclerosis 
exclusion criteria included second primary cancers  without multiple sclerosis 
exclusion criteria included no health care coverage without multiple sclerosis 
exclusion criteria included concurrent primary cancers  without those with any demyelinating disease
exclusion criteria included second primary cancers  without those with any demyelinating disease
exclusion criteria included  for the patients without those with any demyelinating disease
exclusion criteria included  for the patients without multiple sclerosis 
cancer outcomes were stage
cancer outcomes were diagnostic interval
cancer outcomes were diagnostic route
multivariable regression analyses controlled for income quintile
multivariable regression analyses controlled for age
multivariable regression analyses controlled for rural residence
multivariable regression analyses controlled for comorbidity
multivariable regression analyses controlled for diagnosis year
multivariable regression analyses controlled for sex
multivariable regression analyses controlled for urban residence
multiple sclerosis was associated with fewer screendetected cancers in possibly colorectal cancer
multiple sclerosis was associated with fewer screendetected cancers in breast
multiple sclerosis was not associated with differences in breast cancer stage at diagnosis
multiple sclerosis was associated with greater odds of stage i colorectal cancer
the median length of the diagnostic interval did not vary between people with and without multiple sclerosis in either the breast
the median length of the diagnostic interval did not vary between people with and without multiple sclerosis in either colorectal cancer cohorts
controlling for disability status attenuated some findings
breast cancers were less likely to be detected through screening cancer more likely to be detected at early stage in people with multiple sclerosis than without multiple sclerosis
breast cancers were less likely to be detected through colorectal cancer more likely to be detected at early stage in people with multiple sclerosis than without multiple sclerosis
