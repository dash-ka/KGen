The multiple sclerosis populations survival from breast cancer and colorectal cancer is compromised . Cancer screening and timely diagnoses affect cancer survival and have not been studied in the multiple sclerosis cancer population . We investigated whether the diagnostic route, cancer stage, or diagnostic interval differed in patients with cancer with and without multiple sclerosis .

We conducted a matched population-based cross-sectional study of breast cancers and colorectal cancers in patients with multiple sclerosis from Ontario, Canada, using administrative data . Exclusion criteria included second or concurrent primary cancers, no health care coverage, and, for the patients without multiple sclerosis, those with any demyelinating disease . Cancer outcomes were diagnostic route, stage, and diagnostic interval . Multivariable regression analyses controlled for age, sex, diagnosis year, income quintile, urban and rural residence, and comorbidity .

multiple sclerosis was associated with fewer screen-detected cancers in breast and possibly colorectal cancer . multiple sclerosis was not associated with differences in breast cancer stage at diagnosis . multiple sclerosis was associated with greater odds of stage I colorectal cancer . The median length of the diagnostic interval did not vary between people with and without multiple sclerosis in either the breast or colorectal cancer cohorts . Controlling for disability status attenuated some findings .

Breast cancers were less likely to be detected through screening and colorectal cancer more likely to be detected at early stage in people with multiple sclerosis than without multiple sclerosis . multiple sclerosis-related disability may prevent people from getting mammogramultiple sclerosis and colonoscopies . Understanding the pathways to earlier detection in both cancers is critical to developing and planning interventions to ameliorate outcomes for people with multiple sclerosis and cancer .
