a recent report estimated the total economic burden of multiple sclerosis in the united states in 2019
a recent report used a prevalencebased approach to estimate the national economic burden of multiple sclerosis
a survey was developed to collect indirect costs from 946 patients with multiple sclerosis
claims from 3 sources were used to obtain direct costs
the total average annual amount paid for patients with matched controls without multiple sclerosis
the total average annual amount paid for patients with multiple sclerosis
direct medical costs reflected the difference in the total average annual amount
medicare claims data
future earnings loss due to premature death attributable to multiple sclerosis was calculated using centers for prevention mortality data
future earnings loss due to premature death attributable to multiple sclerosis was calculated using centers for disease control
direct costs of indirect productivity loss being important cost drivers
multiple sclerosis is a costly chronic disease with direct costs of prescription drugs

direct costs of prescription drugs being important cost drivers
our findings suggested that the burden of multiple sclerosis in the united states has been underestimated
