Our aim was to study the development of pure sleep epilepsy after a first-ever seizure from sleep in adults .

This was a prospective observational study of patients seen at a tertiary hospitalâ€“based first seizure clinic between 2000 and 2011 . Adults with a first-ever unprovoked seizure from sleep were consecutively recruited . All patients were followed up at least once after the initial seizure, and those not requiring regular clinical review were contacted every 1 to 2 years . The timing and pattern of subsequent seizures and potential predictors of future awake seizures were analyzed .

Two hundred thirty-nine adults with a first-ever unprovoked seizure from sleep were identified . Of the 174 patients who had recurrent seizures, 130 patients had their second seizure from sleep, and of these, 76 of 94 also had their third seizure from sleep . Eighty-nine patients developed awake seizures during follow-up . In half of these patients, the awake seizure occurred within 2 years of the initial seizure . The risk of an awake seizure within 1 year of a first-ever seizure from sleep was 13.9 percent, falling to 2 percent to 5.3 percent per year after 3 years . The risks of an awake seizure within 1 year of a second or third consecutive sleep seizure were 9.9 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively, and similarly decreased with time .

Most initial seizure recurrences after a first-ever sleep seizure occur during sleep . While more than one-third eventually had awake seizures, the annual risk of an awake seizure was below 14 percent and decreased with time, albeit with a small ongoing risk of between 2 percent and 5 percent per year . These findings may be used in counseling patients with seizures from sleep and to inform driving recommendations .
