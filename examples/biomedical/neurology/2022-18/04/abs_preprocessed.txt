dementia are common among older adults
dementia are common among share risk factors
peripheral nerve impairments are common among older adults
peripheral nerve impairments are common among share risk factors
however few studies have examined whether peripheral nerve function and dementia are associated
we evaluated whether lower extremity peripheral nerve impairments were associated with higher incidence of dementia
we evaluated whether associations differed by comorbidity subgroups
we studied black and white health aging and body composition study participants 70 without dementia at enrollment
we studied black and white health aging and body composition study participants 70 to 79 years of age at enrollment
motor peripheral nerve function was measured at year 4
lower extremity sensory was measured at year 4
sensory nerve impairments were measured with vibration threshold of the toe
sensory nerve impairments were measured with monofilament threshold of the toe
vibration detection impairment was defined as above 130 micrometers
monofilament insensitivity was defined as unable to detect monofilament
fibular motor impairments were defined as smaller than 1 mv compound motor action potential amplitude
fibular motor impairments were defined as smaller than slow nerve conduction velocity below 40 meters per second
incident dementia over the following 11 years was determined from medical records
incident dementia over the following 11 years was determined from cognitive scores
incident dementia over the following 11 years was determined from medications
demographics assessed associations of nerve impairments with incident dementia
cox proportional hazard models adjusted for demographics
cox proportional hazard models adjusted for health conditions
health conditions assessed associations of nerve impairments with incident dementia
monofilament 10 g were associated with a higher risk of dementia after covariate adjustment
vibration detection insensitivity were associated with a higher risk of dementia after covariate adjustment
estimates were elevated for monofilament 14 g
estimates were significant for monofilament 14 g
estimates were elevated for compound motor action potential amplitude
estimates were significant for conduction velocity
estimates were significant for compound motor action potential amplitude
estimates were elevated for conduction velocity
increasing number of peripheral nerve impairments was associated with higher risk of dementia in a graded fashion
in subgroup analyses effect estimates were generally higher among those with apoe epsilon4 allele except for vibration detection
in subgroup analyses effect estimates were generally higher among those with diabetes except for vibration detection
in subgroup analyses effect estimates were generally higher among those with low vitamin b12 except for vibration detection
peripheral nerve impairments especially sensory were associated with a higher risk of dementia even after adjustment for age health factors
peripheral nerve impairments especially sensory were associated with a higher risk of dementia even after adjustment for other health factors
these associations may represent a shared susceptibility to nervous system degeneration
