the goal of this work was to determine whether the prevalence of multiple sclerosis varies by race
the goal of this work was to determine whether the prevalence of multiple sclerosis varies by ethnicity
we conducted a retrospective cohort study of over 26 million adults from the multiethnic communitydwelling members of kaiser permanente southern california
the complete electronic health records of individuals with at least 1 icd9 code for multiple sclerosis between january 1 2008 were reviewed
the complete electronic health records of individuals with at least 1 icd9 code for multiple sclerosis between december 31 2010 were reviewed
multiple sclerosis prevalence stratified by age among 2010 members
multiple sclerosis prevalence were estimated with binomial regression
95 percent cis were estimated with binomial regression
multiple sclerosis prevalence stratified by race among 2010 members
multiple sclerosis prevalence stratified by sex among 2010 members
95 percent cis stratified by race among 2010 members
multiple sclerosis prevalence stratified by ethnicity among 2010 members
95 percent cis stratified by ethnicity among 2010 members
95 percent cis stratified by sex among 2010 members
95 percent cis stratified by age among 2010 members
sexstandardized prevalence was estimated according to the 2010 us census population
agestandardized was estimated according to the 2010 us census population
multiple sclerosis prevalence declined after 65 years of age across all ethnic groups
multiple sclerosis prevalence declined after 65 years of age across all racial groups
multiple sclerosis prevalence was highest between the ages of 35 years
multiple sclerosis prevalence was highest between the ages of 64 years
among adults 18 to 24 years of age the crude multiple sclerosis prevalence was highest among hispanic young adults
among adults 18 to 24 years of age the crude multiple sclerosis prevalence was low
among adults 18 to 24 years of age the crude multiple sclerosis prevalence was lower in white people
among adults 18 to 24 years of age the crude multiple sclerosis prevalence was lowest in pacific islander individuals
among adults 18 to 24 years of age the crude multiple sclerosis prevalence was lowest in asian islander individuals
among adults 18 to 24 years of age the crude multiple sclerosis prevalence was highest among black young adults
multiple sclerosis prevalence varies by ethnicity being similarly high in black in asian persons in southern california

multiple sclerosis prevalence varies by race being similarly high in black in asian persons in southern california
multiple sclerosis prevalence varies by race being similarly high in black in hispanic persons in southern california
taken together with previous studies these findings indicate that the burden of multiple sclerosis in the us black community has long been underrecognized
more studies are needed to determine whether multiple sclerosis susceptibility and prevalence vary among asian individuals from different cultures
