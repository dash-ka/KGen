The goal of this work was to determine whether the prevalence of multiple sclerosis varies by race and ethnicity .

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of over 2.6 million adults from the multiethnic, community-dwelling members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California . The complete electronic health records of individuals with at least 1 ICD-9 code for multiple sclerosis between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010 were reviewed . multiple sclerosis prevalence and 95 percent CIs stratified by age, sex, and race and ethnicity among 2010 members were estimated with binomial regression. Age-standardized and sex-standardized prevalence was estimated according to the 2010 US Census population .

multiple sclerosis prevalence was highest between the ages of 35 and 64 years and declined after 65 years of age across all racial and ethnic groups . Among adults 18 to 24 years of age, the crude multiple sclerosis prevalence was low but was highest among Black and Hispanic young adults, lower in White people, and lowest in Asian and Pacific Islander individuals .

multiple sclerosis prevalence varies by race and ethnicity, being similarly high in White and Black and significantly lower in Hispanic and Asian persons in Southern California . Taken together with previous studies, these findings indicate that the burden of multiple sclerosis in the US Black community has long been underrecognized . More studies are needed to determine whether multiple sclerosis is an emerging disease among US Hispanic adults and whether multiple sclerosis susceptibility and prevalence vary among Hispanic or Asian individuals from different cultures or ancestral backgrounds .
