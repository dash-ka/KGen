this study related motor phenotypes to the modified rankin scale specifically aiming to compare modified rankin scale outcomes to meaningful changes in function from acute to subacute recovery after stroke
this study related motor phenotypes to the modified rankin scale specifically aiming to determine whether modified rankin scale levels distinguish motor impairment after stroke

patients with upper extremity weakness after ischemic stroke were assessed with a battery of functional measures within the first week after stroke
patients with upper extremity weakness after ischemic stroke were assessed with a battery of functional measures at 90 days after stroke
patients with upper extremity weakness after ischemic stroke were assessed with a battery of impairment measures within the first week after stroke
patients with upper extremity weakness after ischemic stroke were assessed with a battery of impairment measures at 90 days after stroke
functional outcomes were examined in relation to 90day modified rankin scale scores
impairment outcomes were examined in relation to 90day modified rankin scale scores
clinically meaningful changes in mobility were examined in relation to 90day
90day modified rankin scale score
clinically meaningful changes in motor impairment were examined in relation to 90day
clinically meaningful changes in activities of daily living were examined in relation to 90day
the modified rankin scale does not precisely distinguish differences in function nor does the modified rankin scale sufficiently capture mobility
the modified rankin scale does not precisely distinguish differences in function nor does the modified rankin scale sufficiently capture activities of daily living status
the modified rankin scale does not precisely distinguish differences in impairment nor does the modified rankin scale sufficiently capture activities of daily living status
the modified rankin scale does not precisely distinguish differences in impairment nor does the modified rankin scale sufficiently capture mobility
the modified rankin scale does not precisely distinguish differences in function nor does the modified rankin scale sufficiently capture meaningful clinical changes across impairment
the modified rankin scale does not precisely distinguish differences in impairment nor does the modified rankin scale sufficiently capture meaningful clinical changes across impairment
the modified rankin scale broadly relates to domainspecific outcomes after stroke confirming the modified rankin scale established value in stroke trials
these findings underscore the potential utility of incorporating detailed phenotypic measures along with the modified rankin scale in future stroke trials
