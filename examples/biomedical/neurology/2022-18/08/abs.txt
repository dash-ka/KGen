Precise measurement of outcomes is essential for stroke trials and clinical care . Prior research has highlighted conceptual differences between global outcome measures such as the modified Rankin Scale and domain-specific measures . This study related motor phenotypes to the modified Rankin Scale, specifically aiming to determine whether modified Rankin Scale levels distinguish motor impairment and function phenotypes, and to compare modified Rankin Scale outcomes to meaningful changes in impairment and function from acute to subacute recovery after stroke .

Patients with upper extremity weakness after ischemic stroke were assessed with a battery of impairment and functional measures within the first week and at 90 days after stroke . Impairment and functional outcomes were examined in relation to 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores . Clinically meaningful changes in motor impairment, activities of daily living, and mobility were examined in relation to 90-day modified Rankin Scale score .


The modified Rankin Scale broadly relates to domain-specific outcomes after stroke, confirming its established value in stroke trials, but it does not precisely distinguish differences in impairment and function, nor does it sufficiently capture meaningful clinical changes across impairment, activities of daily living status, and mobility . These findings underscore the potential utility of incorporating detailed phenotypic measures along with the modified Rankin Scale in future stroke trials .
