the prevalence of midlife cardiovascular conditions is higher in men than women
the prevalence of risk factors is higher in men than women
midlife cognitive decline have been reported
associations between midlife cardiovascular conditions have been reported
few studies have assessed sex differences in midlife cognitive decline
few studies have assessed sex differences in risk factors
few studies have assessed sex differences in associations between midlife cardiovascular conditions
risk factors have been reported
we included 1857 participants who were 50 to 69 years of age at baseline
1857 participants enrolled in the populationbased mayo clinic study of aging
participants were evaluated every 15 months by a coordinator
participants were evaluated every 15 months by neurologic evaluation
participants were evaluated every 15 months by neuropsychological testing
the neuropsychological testing used 9 tests to calculate global domainspecific z scores
the neuropsychological testing used 9 tests to calculate global cognitive z scores
nurse abstractors risk factors
nurse abstractors reviewed participant medical records to determine the presence of cardiovascular conditions
linear mixedeffect models evaluated the association between baseline cardiovascular conditions
linear mixedeffect models evaluated the association between risk factors
linear mixedeffect models evaluated the association between global cognitive decline
linear mixedeffect models evaluated the association between domainspecific cognitive decline
multivariable models adjusted for other medical conditions
multivariable models adjusted for depression
multivariable models adjusted for apoe genotype
multivariable models adjusted for demographics
interactions between sex were examined
interactions between each cardiovascular condition were examined
results were stratified by sex
interactions between risk factor were examined
overall 1465 participants had at least 1 cardiovascular condition
overall 1465 participants had risk factor
the proportion of men was higher than women
crosssectionally coronary heart disease were associated with a lower visuospatial z score in multivariable models
crosssectionally ever smoking were associated with a lower visuospatial z score in multivariable models
longitudinally risk factors were associated with declines in global z scores but not visuospatial z scores
longitudinally several cardiovascular conditions were associated with declines in global z scores but not visuospatial z scores
longitudinally risk factors were associated with declines in domainspecific z scores but not visuospatial z scores
longitudinally several cardiovascular conditions were associated with declines in domainspecific z scores but not visuospatial z scores
most cardiovascular conditions were more strongly associated with cognition among women
other cardiovascular conditions were associated with global cognitive decline only in women
coronary heart disease were associated with global cognitive decline only in women
in addition diabetes were associated with language z score decline only in women
in addition dyslipidemia were associated with language z score decline only in women
in addition coronary heart disease were associated with language z score decline only in women
however congestive heart failure was associated with language z score decline only in men
risk factors are associated with midlife cognitive decline
midlife cardiovascular conditions are associated with midlife cognitive decline
moreover risk factors have stronger associations with cognitive decline in midlife for women than men despite the higher prevalence of those conditions in men
moreover specific cardiovascular conditions have stronger associations with cognitive decline in midlife for women than men despite the higher prevalence of those conditions in men
