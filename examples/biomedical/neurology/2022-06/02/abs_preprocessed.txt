we investigated memory trajectories before and after recurrent strokes in 18 european countries
we tested whether the countrylevel acute stroke care was associated with memory change after stroke
we investigated memory trajectories before and after first strokes in 18 european countries
data were from the survey of retirement in europe
data were from the survey of health in europe
data were from the survey of ageing in europe
recurrent strokes were identified among baseline strokefree individuals
incident first were identified among baseline strokefree individuals
a strokefree individual using propensity score matching
within each country each participant with incident stroke was matched with a strokefree individual
we accelerated memory changes before and after first strokes in both groups
we applied multilevel segmented linear regression to quantify acute
we accelerated memory changes before and after recurrent strokes in both groups
associations between stroke were compared between countries with different levels of acute stroke care indicators
associations between memory were compared between countries with different levels of acute stroke care indicators
35164 participants who were strokefree at baseline
the final analytical sample included 35164 participants
a total of 341 recurrent strokes between 2004 were identified
a total of 2362 incident first were identified
a total of 341 recurrent strokes between 2019 were identified
in case groups mean acute decreases in memory scores were 114 words after first stroke respectively independent of a range of confounders
in case groups mean acute decreases in memory scores were 048 words after recurrent stroke respectively independent of a range of confounders
in case groups mean acute decreases in memory scores were 048 words after first stroke respectively independent of a range of confounders
in case groups mean acute decreases in memory scores were 114 words after recurrent stroke respectively independent of a range of confounders
no such acute decreases were observed in the control group after a hypothetical nonstroke onset date
memory declined over time
decline rates were similar
in both groups
the mean acute decreases in memory scores after first strokes were smaller in countries with better access to endovascular treatment
the mean acute decreases in memory scores after recurrent strokes were smaller in countries with better access to endovascular treatment
we found acute decreases
we found accelerated declines in memory after first strokes
we found accelerated declines in memory after recurrent strokes
more evidence based on individuallevel data is needed
improved endovascular therapy might be associated with smaller memory loss after stroke
