although there is evidence of disruption in cardiovascular care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic downstream effect in primary care is less clear
although there is evidence of disruption in acute cerebrovascular the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic downstream effect in primary care is less clear
we investigated how the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic determined changes in general practicerecorded diagnoses of selected cardiovascular outcomes
we investigated how the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic affected utilization of cerebrovascular care in general practices
we investigated how the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic affected utilization of cardiovascular care in general practices
we investigated how the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic determined changes in general practicerecorded diagnoses of selected cerebrovascular outcomes
from electronic health records of 166929 primary care patients over within the rotterdam region the netherlands we extracted first diagnoses of selected cerebrovascular factors
from electronic health records of 166929 primary care patients over within the rotterdam region the netherlands we extracted conditions
from electronic health records of 166929 primary care patients aged 30 we extracted first diagnoses of selected cerebrovascular factors
from electronic health records of 166929 primary care patients aged 30 we extracted first diagnoses of selected cardiovascular risk factors
from electronic health records of 166929 primary care patients aged 30 we extracted conditions
consultations related to cardiovascular care
from electronic health records of 166929 primary care patients over within the rotterdam region the netherlands we extracted the number of consultations
from electronic health records of 166929 primary care patients aged 30 we extracted the number of consultations
from electronic health records of 166929 primary care patients over within the rotterdam region the netherlands we extracted first diagnoses of selected cardiovascular risk factors
consultations related to cerebrovascular care
from electronic health records of 166929 primary care patients aged 30 we extracted events
from electronic health records of 166929 primary care patients over within the rotterdam region the netherlands we extracted events
we quantified changes in those outcomes during the first coronavirus disease the first wave and thereafter by comparing the first coronavirus disease 2019 wave and thereafter to the same period in 2016 to 2019
we also estimated the number of potentially missed diagnoses for each outcome
general practice consultations related to cerebrovascular care
general practice consultations related to cardiovascular care
the number of general practice consultations declined by 38 percent during the first wave as compared to expected counts based on prepandemic levels
substantial declines in the number of new diagnoses were observed for cerebrovascular events while no significant changes were observed for cardiovascular events
the number of general practice consultations remained lower than expected throughout the june to december period
the counts across individual diagnoses recovered following the june
general practice consultations related to cerebrovascular care
general practice consultations related to cardiovascular care
while new diagnoses of acute cardiovascular events remained stable during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic diagnoses of cerebrovascular events declined substantially compared to prepandemic levels possibly due to incorrect perception of risk by patients
these findings emphasize the need to improve symptom recognition of cerebrovascular events among the general public
these findings emphasize the need to encourage urgent presentation despite any physical distancing measures
