cerebral cortical microinfarcts are a novel mri marker of cerebrovascular disease
cerebrovascular disease that predicts accelerated cognitive decline
the mechanism linking the two
presence of cerebral cortical microinfarcts is known to be associated with global cortical atrophy although the mechanism is unclear
our primary objective was to examine the relation between cerebral cortical microinfarcts
our primary objective was to examine the relation between cortical atrophy
possible perilesional atrophy surrounding cerebral cortical microinfarcts
our primary objective was to establish possible perilesional atrophy
our primary objective was to examine the role of cortical atrophy in cerebral cortical microinfarctassociated cognitive impairment
patients included if patients received the diagnosis alzheimer dementia
patients included if patients received the diagnosis vascular dementia
patients were recruited from 2 singapore memory clinics between september 2013
patients included if patients received the diagnosis cognitive impairment
patients included if patients received the diagnosis no objective cognitive impairment
patients were recruited from 2 singapore memory clinics between december 2010
cortical thickness were assessed on 3t mri
mri markers of cerebrovascular disease were assessed on 3t mri
chronic cerebral cortical microinfarcts were assessed on 3t mri
patients underwent cognitive testing
individual patients with cerebral cortical microinfarcts comparing brain regions with cerebral cortical microinfarcts
cortical thickness was compared globally between patients with and without cerebral cortical microinfarcts regionally within individual patients with cerebral cortical microinfarcts to the corresponding contralateral region without cerebral cortical microinfarcts and locally within individuals patients in a 50mm radius of cerebral cortical microinfarcts
global cortical thickness was analyzed as mediator in the relation between cognitive performance
global cortical thickness was analyzed as mediator in the relation between cerebral cortical microinfarct
of the 238 patients enrolled 75 had at least 1 cerebral cortical microinfarct
patient with cerebral cortical microinfarcts had a 21 percent lower global cortical thickness compared to patients without cerebral cortical microinfarcts after correction for age
patient with cerebral cortical microinfarcts had a 21 percent lower global cortical thickness compared to patients without cerebral cortical microinfarcts after correction for intracranial volume
patient with cerebral cortical microinfarcts had a 21 percent lower global cortical thickness compared to patients without cerebral cortical microinfarcts after correction for education
patient with cerebral cortical microinfarcts had a 21 percent lower global cortical thickness compared to patients without cerebral cortical microinfarcts after correction for sex
in patients with cerebral cortical microinfarcts cortical thickness in brain regions with cerebral cortical microinfarcts was 22 percent lower than in contralateral regions without cerebral cortical microinfarcts
in a 20mm radius area cortical thickness was lower than in a 20mm radius area surrounding the cerebral cortical microinfarct core to 50 mm from the cerebral cortical microinfarct core
a 20mm radius area surrounding the cerebral cortical microinfarct core
global cortical thickness was a significant mediator in the relationship between cognitive performance as measure with the minimental state examination
global cortical thickness was a significant mediator in the relationship between cerebral cortical microinfarct presence as measure with the minimental state examination
cortical atrophy suggesting a perilesional effect in a cortical area many times larger than the cerebral cortical microinfarct core
we found cortical atrophy
cortical atrophy surrounding cerebral cortical microinfarcts
we findings support the notion that cerebral cortical microinfarcts affect brain structure beyond the actual lesion site
