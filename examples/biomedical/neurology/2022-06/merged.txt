we also estimated the number of potentially missed diagnoses for each outcome
general practice consultations related to cerebrovascular care
general practice consultations related to cardiovascular care
the number of general practice consultations declined by 38 percent during the first wave as compared to expected counts based on prepandemic levels
substantial declines in the number of new diagnoses were observed for cerebrovascular events while no significant changes were observed for cardiovascular events
the number of general practice consultations remained lower than expected throughout the june to december period
the counts across individual diagnoses recovered following the june

general practice consultations related to cardiovascular care
while new diagnoses of acute cardiovascular events remained stable during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic diagnoses of cerebrovascular events declined substantially compared to prepandemic levels possibly due to incorrect perception of risk by patients
