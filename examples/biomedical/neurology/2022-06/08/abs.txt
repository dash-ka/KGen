To report the clinical, biological, and imaging features and clinical course of a French cohort of patients with glial fibrillary acidic protein autoantibodies.

We retrospectively included all patients who tested positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies in the CSF by immunohistochemistry and confirmed by cell-based assay using cells expressing human glial fibrillary acidic proteinÎ± since 2017 from 2 French referral centers .

We identified 46 patients with glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies . Median age at onset was 43 years, and 65 percent were men . Infectious prodromal symptoms were found in 82 percent . Other autoimmune diseases were found in 22 percent of patients, and coexisting neural autoantibodies in 11 percent . Tumors were present in 24 percent, and T-cell dysfunction in 23 percent. The most frequent presentation was subacute meningoencephalitis, with cerebellar dysfunction in 57 percent of cases . Other clinical presentations included myelitis and visual and peripheral nervous system involvement . MRI showed perivascular radial enhancement in 32 percent, periventricular T2 hyperintensity in 41 percent, brainstem involvement in 31 percent, leptomeningeal enhancement in 26 percent, and reversible splenial lesions in 4 cases . A total of 33 of 40 patients had a monophasic course, associated with a good outcome at last follow-up, despite a severe clinical presentation . Adult and pediatric features are similar . Thirty-two patients were treated with immunotherapy . A total of 11 out of 22 patients showed negative conversion of glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies .

glial fibrillary acidic protein autoimmunity is mainly associated with acute meningoencephalomyelitis and subacute meningoencephalomyelitis with prodromal symptoms, for which tumors and T-cell dysfunction are frequent triggers . The majority of patients followed a monophasic course with a good outcome .
