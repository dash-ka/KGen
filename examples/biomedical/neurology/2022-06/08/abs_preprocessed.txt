to report clinical course of a french cohort of patients with glial fibrillary acidic protein autoantibodies
to report biological
cellbased assay using cells expressing human glial fibrillary acidic proteina since 2017 from 2 french referral centers
all patients who confirmed by cellbased assay
all patients who tested positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies in the csf by immunohistochemistry
we retrospectively included all patients
we identified 46 patients with glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies
median age at onset was 43 years
65 percent were men
infectious prodromal symptoms were found in 82 percent
coexisting neural autoantibodies in 11 percent
other autoimmune diseases were found in 22 percent of patients
tumors were present in 24 percent
tumors were present in tcell dysfunction in 23 percent
the most frequent presentation was subacute meningoencephalitis with cerebellar dysfunction in 57 percent of cases
other clinical presentations included visual
other clinical presentations included peripheral nervous system involvement
other clinical presentations included myelitis
mri showed periventricular t2 hyperintensity in 41 percent
mri showed perivascular radial enhancement in 32 percent
mri showed leptomeningeal enhancement in 26 percent
mri showed reversible splenial lesions in 4 cases
mri showed brainstem involvement in 31 percent
a total of 33 of 40 patients had a monophasic course associated with a good outcome at last followup despite a severe clinical presentation
adult are similar
pediatric features are similar
thirtytwo patients were treated with immunotherapy
a total of 11 out of 22 patients showed negative conversion of glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies
glial fibrillary acidic protein autoimmunity is mainly associated with acute meningoencephalomyelitis with prodromal symptoms
glial fibrillary acidic protein autoimmunity is mainly associated with subacute meningoencephalomyelitis with prodromal symptoms
prodromal symptoms for which tumors are frequent triggers
prodromal symptoms for which tcell dysfunction are frequent triggers
the majority of patients followed a monophasic course with a good outcome
