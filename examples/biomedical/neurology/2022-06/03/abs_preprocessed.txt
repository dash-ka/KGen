the presence of postinterventional subarachnoid hyperdensities is a relatively common finding after mechanical thrombectomy
we aimed to assess the incidence after mechanical thrombectomy as
we aimed to assess clinical relevance after mechanical thrombectomy as
we aimed to assess predictors of subarachnoid hyperdensities after mechanical thrombectomy as
mechanical thrombectomy as categorized through the use of postinterventional dualenergy ct
we aimed to assess characteristics after mechanical thrombectomy as
a singlecenter consecutive series of patients with acute stroke was retrospectively reviewed
acute stroke treated with mechanical thrombectomy
posttreatment subarachnoid hyperdensities were defined as incident extraaxial hyperdensities in a followup dualenergy ct
a followup dualenergy ct performed within a median of 8 hours after mechanical thrombectomy
subarachnoid hyperdensities were further
further classified according to subarachnoid hyperdensities content and extension
adjusted logistic regression models assessed the association of subarachnoid hyperdensities with poor clinical outcome
adjusted logistic regression models assessed the association of subarachnoid hyperdensities with procedural variables
adjusted logistic regression models assessed the association of subarachnoid hyperdensities with pretreatment variables
subarachnoid hyperdensities were observed in 120 of the 424 included patients
in this group subarachnoid hyperdensities were diffuse in nondiffuse in 48 patients
in this group subarachnoid hyperdensities were diffuse in 72 patients in 48 patients
diffuse subarachnoid hyperdensities were significantly associated with worse clinical outcome in adjusted models unlike the specific subarachnoid hyperdensities content alone
in contrast with the absence of subarachnoid hyperdensities only the diffuse pattern with blood extravasation was significantly associated with worse clinical outcome
diffuse subarachnoid hyperdensities patterns were predicted by m2 occlusions concurrent parenchymal hematomas
diffuse subarachnoid hyperdensities patterns were predicted by m2 occlusions more thrombectomy passes
in our cohort of patients imaged within a median of 8 hours after mechanical thrombectomy postinterventional subarachnoid hyperdensities showed a diffuse pattern in 17 percent of thrombectomies
in our cohort of patients imaged within a median of 8 hours after mechanical thrombectomy postinterventional subarachnoid hyperdensities were associated with more arduous procedures
local collections of contrast extravasations were associated with an increased risk of poor outcome and death
diffuse subarachnoid hyperdensities were associated with an increased risk of poor outcome and death
local collections of blood extravasations were associated with an increased risk of poor outcome and death
these findings reinforce the need for improvement in reperfusion strategies
proximal carotid artery territory occlusions treated with mechanical thrombectomy
these findings provides class iv evidence that in individuals with proximal carotid artery territory occlusions diffuse postinterventional subarachnoid hyperdensities on imaging 8 hours postprocedure are associated with worse clinical outcomes at 90 days
