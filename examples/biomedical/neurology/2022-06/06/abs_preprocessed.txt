to our knowledge no study has investigated the effect of exposure to formaldehyde on cognition in the general population
our objective was to examine the association between occupational exposure to cognitive impairment in youngold adults
our objective was to examine the association between occupational exposure to cognitive impairment in middleaged adults
our objective was to examine the association between occupational exposure to formaldehyde impairment in youngold adults
our objective was to examine the association between occupational exposure to formaldehyde impairment in middleaged adults
in the french constances cohort cognitive function was assessed with a standardized battery of 7 cognitive tests to evaluate global cognitive function
in the french constances cohort cognitive function was assessed with a standardized battery of 7 cognitive tests to evaluate episodic verbal memory
in the french constances cohort cognitive function was assessed with a standardized battery of 7 cognitive tests to evaluate executive functions
in the french constances cohort cognitive function was assessed with a standardized battery of 7 cognitive tests to evaluate language abilities
a global cognitive score was created using principal component analysis
cognitive impairment was assessed in reference to norms of neuropsychological battery according to sex
cognitive impairment was assessed in reference to norms of neuropsychological battery according to age
cognitive impairment was assessed in reference to norms of neuropsychological battery according to education
lifetime exposure to formaldehyde was assessed using a french job exposure matrix
a french job exposure matrix created in the framework of the matgene project
after performing multiple imputation separate were used to evaluate the association between cognitive impairment
after performing multiple imputation separate were used to evaluate the association between exposure duration
after performing multiple imputation separate were used to evaluate the association between formaldehyde exposure
separate modified poisson regression models
after performing multiple imputation separate were used to evaluate time of last exposure
after performing multiple imputation separate were used to evaluate the association between cumulative exposure index
after performing multiple imputation separate were used to evaluate the association between combination of cumulative exposure index
among 75322 participants 8 percent were exposed to formaldehyde during 75322 participants professional life
75322 participants were at higher risk of global cognitive impairment after adjusting for confounders
all cognitive domains explored
75322 participants were at higher risk of cognitive impairment for all cognitive domains
high cumulative exposure index were associated with cognitive impairment with a doseeffect relationship for exposure duration
longer exposure duration were associated with cognitive impairment with a doseeffect relationship for exposure duration
recent exposure was associated with impairment in all cognitive domains
time did not fully attenuate formaldehydeassociated cognitive deficits especially in highly exposed individuals
our findings highlight the longterm detrimental effect of formaldehyde exposure on cognitive health in a relatively young population
