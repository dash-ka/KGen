we studied the global distribution of risk factors causes with ischemic stroke by performing a patient data metaanalysis from different cohorts worldwide
we studied 3month mortality of young patients with ischemic stroke by performing a patient data metaanalysis from different cohorts worldwide
ischemic stroke aged 18 to 50 years
we performed a pooled analysis of individual patient data from cohort studies
cohort studies that included consecutive patients with ischemic stroke
we studied differences in prevalence of risk factors and causes of ischemic stroke between different ethnic geographic regions and countries with different income levels
we studied differences in prevalence of risk factors and causes of ischemic stroke between racial groups geographic regions and countries with different income levels
we investigated differences in 3month mortality by mixedeffects multivariable logistic regression
we included 17663 patients from 32 cohorts in 29 countries
diabetes were most prevalent in asian patients
diabetes were most prevalent in black patients
hypertension were most prevalent in asian patients
hypertension were most prevalent in black patients
other determined undetermined stroke
large vessel atherosclerosis were more often the because of stroke in highincome countries whereas other were higher in middleincome countries
small vessel disease were more often the because of stroke in highincome countries whereas other were higher in low countries
small vessel disease were more often the because of stroke in highincome countries whereas other were higher in middleincome countries
large vessel atherosclerosis were more often the because of stroke in highincome countries whereas other were higher in low countries
other determined stroke
had less vascular risk factors
patients in low countries were younger
patients in middleincome countries were younger
despite this more often died within 3 months than those from highincome countries
regional differences in risk factors and causes of stroke at young age provide an understanding of ethnic
ethnoracial provide an understanding of racial
ethnoracial provide an understanding of ethnic
regional differences in risk factors and causes of stroke at young age provide regional differences in incidence of ischemic stroke
regional differences in risk factors and causes of stroke at young age provide an understanding of racial
ethnoracial provide regional differences in incidence of ischemic stroke
highincome countries which should serve as call to action to improve health care facilities in low countries
our results also highlight the dissimilarities in outcome after stroke in young adults
young adults that exist between middleincome countries
young adults that exist between highincome countries
highincome countries which should serve as call to action to improve health care facilities in middleincome countries
young adults that exist between low countries
