There is a worldwide increase in the incidence of stroke in young adults, with major regional and ethnic differences . Advancing knowledge of ethnic and regional variation in causes and outcomes will be beneficial in implementation of regional health care services . We studied the global distribution of risk factors, causes, and 3-month mortality of young patients with ischemic stroke, by performing a patient data meta-analysis from different cohorts worldwide .

We performed a pooled analysis of individual patient data from cohort studies that included consecutive patients with ischemic stroke aged 18 to 50 years . We studied differences in prevalence of risk factors and causes of ischemic stroke between different ethnic and racial groups, geographic regions, and countries with different income levels . We investigated differences in 3-month mortality by mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression .

We included 17,663 patients from 32 cohorts in 29 countries . Hypertension and diabetes were most prevalent in Black and Asian patients . Large vessel atherosclerosis and small vessel disease were more often the cause of stroke in high-income countries, whereas other determined stroke and undetermined stroke were higher in low and middle-income countries . Patients in low and middle-income countries were younger, had less vascular risk factors, and despite this, more often died within 3 months than those from high-income countries .

Ethnoracial and regional differences in risk factors and causes of stroke at young age provide an understanding of ethnic and racial and regional differences in incidence of ischemic stroke . Our results also highlight the dissimilarities in outcome after stroke in young adults that exist between low and middle-income countries and high-income countries, which should serve as call to action to improve health care facilities in low and middle-income countries .
