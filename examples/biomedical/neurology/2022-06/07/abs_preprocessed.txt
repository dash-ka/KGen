many previous studies mostly performed in western countries on the effects of lifestyle factors on parkinson disease used baseline lifestyle characteristics without directly accounting for changes in covariate values over time
the objective of parkinson disease was to evaluate the association of repeatedly measured lifestyle factors with parkinson disease risk in a korean population
we conducted a nationwide populationbased cohort study
individuals who followed up until december 31 2015
among 512836 koreans in the national health checkup database we selected individuals
individuals who underwent health screening at least 3 times between 2015
individuals who underwent health screening at least 3 times between 2002
parkinson disease was defined using the icd10 code g20
data on lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption were collected using selfreported questionnaires
data on lifestyle factors such as smoking were collected using selfreported questionnaires
data on lifestyle factors such as physical activity were collected using selfreported questionnaires
timedependent covariates using generalized estimation equation models
logistic regression analysis with timedependent covariates was performed to determine parkinson disease development
during the 14year followup 2665 patients developed parkinson disease
smoking showed a doseresponse inverse association with parkinson disease only in men
regular physical activity were related to reduced parkinson disease development in both sexes
alcohol consumption were related to reduced parkinson disease development in both sexes
however alcohol consumption in men had more consistent associations with parkinson disease development compared to those of the other sex
however alcohol consumption in physical activity in women had more consistent associations with parkinson disease development compared to those of the other sex
participants with regular health screening showed a consistent relationship between parkinson disease development whereas lifestyle factors in those without regular health screening had a decreased relationship with parkinson disease even smoking habit
participants with regular health screening showed a consistent relationship between lifestyle factors whereas lifestyle factors in those without regular health screening had a decreased relationship with parkinson disease even smoking habit
analysis showed an association between lifestyle factors
analysis using repeatedly measured lifestyle factors
analysis showed an association between parkinson disease development
characteristics of lifestyle data might influence results

regularity
repeated measurements
future studies with appropriate lifestyle factors could increase parkinson disease risk prediction
timing
parkinson disease provides class ii evidence that alcohol use are associated with reduced risk of parkinson disease in a korean population
parkinson disease provides class ii evidence that smoking are associated with reduced risk of parkinson disease in a korean population
parkinson disease provides class ii evidence that physical activity are associated with reduced risk of parkinson disease in a korean population
