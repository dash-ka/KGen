We aim to determine the risk of stroke and death within 30 days after stroke in nasopharyngeal cancer survivors.

We conducted a population-based cohort study of patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2017 . Using the cancer and stroke disease registries and the Singapore general population as the reference population, we report the age-standardized incidence rate differences ratios and the cumulative incidence of stroke and the standardized mortality rate differences and ratios for all causes of death within 30 days after stroke for nasopharyngeal cancer survivors.

The overall risk of stroke was markedly elevated in survivors of nasopharyngeal cancer, especially in stage 1 disease, compared to the general population . The risk of death within 30 days of stroke was not significantly higher for nasopharyngeal cancer survivors .

This study provides Class II evidence of the increased risk of stroke in survivors of nasopharyngeal cancer compared to the general population .
