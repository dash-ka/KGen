we aim to determine the risk of stroke within 30 days after stroke in nasopharyngeal cancer survivors
we aim to determine the risk of death within 30 days after stroke in nasopharyngeal cancer survivors
we conducted a populationbased cohort study of patients
patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer from january 1 2005 to december 31 2017
using the singapore general population as the reference population we report the agestandardized incidence rate differences ratios after stroke for nasopharyngeal cancer survivors
using stroke disease registries we report the agestandardized incidence rate differences ratios after stroke for nasopharyngeal cancer survivors
using the cancer we report the cumulative incidence of stroke after stroke for nasopharyngeal cancer survivors
using stroke disease registries we report the cumulative incidence of stroke after stroke for nasopharyngeal cancer survivors
using stroke disease registries we report the standardized mortality rate differences and ratios for all causes of death within 30 days after stroke for nasopharyngeal cancer survivors
using the cancer we report the agestandardized incidence rate differences ratios after stroke for nasopharyngeal cancer survivors
using the cancer we report the standardized mortality rate differences and ratios for all causes of death within 30 days after stroke for nasopharyngeal cancer survivors
using the singapore general population as the reference population we report the standardized mortality rate differences and ratios for all causes of death within 30 days after stroke for nasopharyngeal cancer survivors
using the singapore general population as the reference population we report the cumulative incidence of stroke after stroke for nasopharyngeal cancer survivors
the overall risk of stroke was markedly elevated in survivors of nasopharyngeal cancer especially in stage 1 disease compared to the general population
the risk of death within 30 days of stroke was not significantly higher for nasopharyngeal cancer survivors
a populationbased cohort study of patients provides class ii evidence of the increased risk of stroke in survivors of nasopharyngeal cancer compared to the general population
patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer from january 1 2005 to december 31 2017
