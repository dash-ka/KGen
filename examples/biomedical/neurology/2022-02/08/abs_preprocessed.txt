the ggc repeat expansion in the 5  untranslated region of notch2nlc was recently identified as the because of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease  niid 
neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease  niid  which may manifest with peripheral neuropathy
the aim of this cohort study is to investigate this cohort study contribution to inherited neuropathy
notch2nlc using repeatprimed pcr
notch2nlc using fragment analysis
this cohort study screened patients with healthy controls for the ggc repeat expansion in notch2nlc
this cohort study screened patients with molecularly undiagnosed charcot marie tooth disease in notch2nlc
the patients harboring the ggc repeat expansion
the clinical features of the patients were scrutinized
the electrophysiologic features of the patients were scrutinized
skin biopsy with electric microscopic imaging were performed
skin biopsy with immunohistochemistry staining were performed
one hundred twentyseven unrelated patients with genetically undiagnosed molecularly undiagnosed charcot marie tooth disease were included
one hundred twentyseven unrelated patients with genetically undiagnosed 66 cases with genetically undiagnosed molecularly undiagnosed charcot marie tooth disease were included
one hundred twentyseven unrelated patients with genetically undiagnosed 200 healthy controls were included
among one hundred twentyseven unrelated patients with molecularly undiagnosed charcot marie tooth disease 7 patients with genetically undiagnosed molecularly undiagnosed charcot marie tooth disease carried a variant notch2nlc allele with ggc repeat expansion
among one hundred twentyseven unrelated patients with 66 cases with 200 healthy controls 7 patients with genetically undiagnosed molecularly undiagnosed charcot marie tooth disease carried a variant notch2nlc allele with ggc repeat expansion
a variant notch2nlc allele was absent in controls
among one hundred twentyseven unrelated patients with 66 cases with axonal molecularly undiagnosed charcot marie tooth disease 7 patients with genetically undiagnosed molecularly undiagnosed charcot marie tooth disease carried a variant notch2nlc allele with ggc repeat expansion
the sizes of the expanded ggc repeats ranged from 80 to 104 repeats
all 7 patients developed sensory predominant neuropathy with an average age at disease onset of 37 years
electrophysiologic studies revealed mild axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy
leukoencephalopathy was absent in the 5 patients
the 5 patients who received a brain mri
skin biopsy from 2 patients showed eosinophilic ubiquitin
skin biopsy from 2 patients showed p62positive intranuclear inclusions in dermal fibroblasts
skin biopsy from 2 patients showed p62positive intranuclear inclusions in the sweat gland cells
two of the 7 patients had a family history of niid
the notch2nlc ggc repeat expansions are an underdiagnosed and important because of inherited neuropathy
the expansion accounts for 106 percent of molecularly unassigned cmt2 cases in the taiwanese genetically undiagnosed molecularly undiagnosed charcot marie tooth disease cohort
this cohort study provides class iii evidence that in taiwanese patients with genetically undiagnosed genetically undiagnosed molecularly undiagnosed charcot marie tooth disease 106 percent of the cmt2 cases have the ggc repeat expansion in notch2nlc
