The GGC repeat expansion in the 5â€² untranslated region of NOTCH2NLC was recently identified as the cause of Neuronal Intranuclear Inclusion Disease (NIID), which may manifest with peripheral neuropathy . The aim of this study is to investigate its contribution to inherited neuropathy .

This cohort study screened patients with molecularly undiagnosed Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) and healthy controls for the GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC using repeat-primed PCR and fragment analysis . The clinical and electrophysiologic features of the patients harboring the GGC repeat expansion were scrutinized . Skin biopsy with immunohistochemistry staining and electric microscopic imaging were performed .

One hundred twenty-seven unrelated patients with CMT, including 66 cases with axonal CMT, and 200 healthy controls were included . Among them, 7 patients with CMT carried a variant NOTCH2NLC allele with GGC repeat expansion, but it was absent in controls . The sizes of the expanded GGC repeats ranged from 80 to 104 repeats . All 7 patients developed sensory predominant neuropathy with an average age at disease onset of 37 years . Electrophysiologic studies revealed mild axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy . Leukoencephalopathy was absent in the 5 patients who received a brain MRI . Skin biopsy from 2 patients showed eosinophilic, ubiquitin- and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in the sweat gland cells and dermal fibroblasts . Two of the 7 patients had a family history of NIID .

The NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions are an underdiagnosed and important cause of inherited neuropathy . The expansion accounts for 10.6 percent of molecularly unassigned CMT2 cases in the Taiwanese CMT cohort .

This study provides Class III evidence that in Taiwanese patients with genetically undiagnosed CMT, 10.6% of the CMT2 cases have the GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC .
