to determine the association between surgical lesions of white structures with favorable postoperative seizure outcomes
to determine the association between surgical lesions of distinct gray with favorable postoperative seizure outcomes
to determine the association between surgical lesions of connections with favorable postoperative seizure outcomes
patients with drugresistant temporal lobe epilepsy from 3 epilepsy centers were included
we employed a connectomebased mapping approach to determine the association between favorable outcomes
we employed a voxelbased mapping approach to determine the association between surgeryinduced temporal lesions
we employed a voxelbased mapping approach to determine the association between favorable outcomes
we employed a connectomebased mapping approach to determine the association between surgeryinduced temporal lesions
analyses were conducted controlling for multiple confounders including site
analyses were conducted controlling for multiple confounders including side of surgery
analyses were conducted controlling for multiple confounders including ablation volume
analyses were conducted controlling for multiple confounders including hippocampal volumes
site where the patient was treated
analyses were conducted controlling for multiple confounders including total surgical resection volume
the cohort included 113 patients with patients with drugresistant temporal lobe epilepsy
epilepsy who were 61 percent free of disabling seizures at followup
surgical lesions that targeted the hippocampus as well as the amygdalapiriform cortex complex disconnection of temporal frontal and limbic regions through loss of white matter tracts within anterior commissure
surgical lesions that targeted the hippocampus as well as the amygdalapiriform cortex complex disconnection of temporal frontal and limbic regions through loss of white matter tracts within functional disconnection of the frontal lobes
surgical lesions that targeted the hippocampus as well as entorhinal cortices disconnection of temporal frontal and limbic regions through loss of white matter tracts within functional disconnection of the temporal lobes
surgical lesions that targeted the hippocampus as well as entorhinal cortices disconnection of temporal frontal and limbic regions through loss of white matter tracts within functional disconnection of the frontal lobes
surgical lesions that targeted the hippocampus as well as the amygdalapiriform cortex complex disconnection of temporal frontal and limbic regions through loss of white matter tracts within the uncinate fasciculus
surgical lesions that targeted the hippocampus as well as the amygdalapiriform cortex complex disconnection of temporal frontal and limbic regions through loss of white matter tracts within fornix

surgical lesions that targeted the hippocampus as well as the amygdalapiriform cortex complex disconnection of temporal frontal and limbic regions through loss of white matter tracts within functional disconnection of the temporal lobes
postoperative seizure freedom in patients with drugresistant temporal lobe epilepsy was associated with surgical lesions
surgical lesions that targeted the hippocampus as well as entorhinal cortices disconnection of temporal frontal and limbic regions through loss of white matter tracts within anterior commissure
better postoperative seizure freedom is associated with surgical lesions of specific structures and connections throughout the temporal lobes
these findings she constitute a promising source of new evidence for future improvements in surgical interventions
these findings she would light on the key components of epileptogenic networks in patients with drugresistant temporal lobe epilepsy
these findings provides class ii evidence that for patients with patients with drugresistant temporal lobe epilepsy postoperative seizure freedom is associated with surgical lesions of specific temporal lobe structures and connections
