we retrieved 40 reports of nof1 trials in neurologic disorders
most nof1 trials were performed in movement disorders
most nof1 trials were performed in neurodegenerative disorders
most nof1 trials were performed in neuromuscular disorders
trials that studied the main symptoms of a chronic stable condition
unlike the majority of trials 9 nof1 trials studied a stable chronic symptom of a progressive neurologic disorder
unlike the majority of trials 9 nof1 trials studied a stable chronic symptom of a acute neurologic disorder
besides pharmacologic interventions nutritional products were studied
besides pharmacologic interventions electric stimulation protocols products were studied
a mean total consolidated standards of reporting trials extension for nof1 score of 2088 were reporting across all nof1 trials
a mean total consolidated standards of reporting trials extension for nof1 score of 2088 were found as methodologic measures of quality
a mean total consolidated standards of mean total jadad score of 290 were found as methodologic measures of quality
a mean total consolidated standards of mean total jadad score of 290 were reporting across all nof1 trials
discussion nof1 trials have been reported in numerous neurologic disorders not only in progressive disorders with a stable symptom
discussion nof1 trials have been reported in numerous neurologic disorders not only in chronic stable disorders
discussion nof1 trials have been reported in numerous neurologic disorders not only in acute disorders with a stable symptom
this indicates the emerging therapeutic area of nof1 trials in neurology
methodologic quality and reporting of nof1 trials can easily be improved in future trials by appropriately describing the methods of blinding
methodologic quality and reporting of nof1 trials were found to be suboptimal
methodologic quality and reporting of nof1 trials can easily be improved in future trials by following consolidated standards of reporting trials extension for nof1 guidelines
methodologic quality and reporting of nof1 trials can easily be improved in future trials by appropriately describing the methods of randomization
because most nof1 trials remain unreported in medical literature this systematic review probably represents only the tip of the iceberg of conducted nof1 trials in neurologic disorders
in addition to conventional trial designs nof1 trials can help to bridge the gap between clinical care by providing an alternative personalized level 1 evidence base for suitable treatments
