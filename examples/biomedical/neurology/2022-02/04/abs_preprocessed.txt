white matter fiber tracts that exhibit structural abnormality in patients with bottom of sulcus dysplasia
wholebrain fixelbased analysis of diffusion mri data was performed to identify white matter fiber tracts with significant reductions in fiber density and crosssection in patients with sulcus dysplasia
sulcus dysplasia when compared to healthy control participants
results from wholebrain analysis were used to investigate the association of fiber tract abnormality with epilepsy duration
results from wholebrain analysis were used to investigate the association of fiber tract abnormality with seizure frequency
despite the focal nature of sulcus dysplasia patients with sulcus dysplasia showed widespread abnormality in white matter fiber tracts including the bilateral corticospinal corticothalamic and cerebellothalamic tracts superior longitudinal fasciculi corpus callosum and the forceps major

this pattern of bilateral connectivity reduction was not related to the laterality of the lesion
exploratory post hoc analyses showed that high seizure frequency was associated with greater reduction in fiber density at the forceps major bilateral cerebellothalamic tracts

we demonstrate evidence of a bilaterally distributed specific white matter network
a bilaterally distributed specific white matter network that is vulnerable to disruption in sulcus dysplasia
additional contributors such as the genetic background have not been excluded
additional contributors such as effects of environment have not been excluded
additional contributors such as effects of treatment have not been excluded
the degree of tract abnormality is partly related to seizure activity
