To determine the effectiveness of a 6-month, interactive, multimodal, Web-based EEG teaching program in improving EEG analysis and interpretation skills for neurologists, neurology residents, and technologists, particularly in resource-limited settings .

Between June 2017 and November 2018, 179 learners originating from 20 African countries, Europe, and the United States were registered on the EEGonline course . Of these, 128 learners participated in the study . Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) test results and EEGonline user logs were analyzed. Differences in performance were correlated with quantified exposure to various EEGonline learning modalities . Participants impressions of EEGonline efficacy and usefulness were assessed through  satisfaction surveys .


This study demonstrated that a multimodal, online EEG teaching tool was effective in improving EEG analysis and interpretation skills and may be useful in resource-poor settings .
