between june 2017 179 learners were registered on the eegonline course
179 learners originating from 20 african countries
179 learners originating from the united states
between november 2018 179 learners were registered on the eegonline course
179 learners originating from europe
179 learners originating from the united states
of 179 learners 128 learners participated in the study
179 learners originating from 20 african countries

multiple choice question test results were analyzed
eegonline user logs were analyzed
differences in performance were correlated with quantified exposure to various eegonline
various eegonline learning modalities
participants impressions of eegonline efficacy and usefulness were assessed through satisfaction surveys
the study demonstrated that a multimodal online eeg teaching tool was effective in improving eeg analysis
the study may be useful in resourcepoor settings
