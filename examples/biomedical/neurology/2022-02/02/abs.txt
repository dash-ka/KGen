The association between levetiracetam and survival with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type glioblastomas is controversial . We investigated whether the duration of levetiracetam use during the standard chemoradiation protocol affects overall survival of patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type glioblastoma .

To assess the survival benefit of levetiracetam use during the standard chemoradiation protocol, a Cox proportional hazard model was constructed . We performed a case-matched analysis between patients with levetiracetam use during the whole duration of the standard chemoradiation protocol and patients with levetiracetam use part time or never . Patients with unavailable O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation status were excluded.

A total of 460 patients were included . The median overall survival was longer in the 116 patients with levetiracetam use during the whole duration of the standard chemoradiation protocol than in the 126 patients with part-time levetiracetam use  and in the 218 patients who never received levetiracetam . Levetiracetam use during the whole duration of the standard chemoradiation protocol, MGMT promoter methylation, and gross total tumor resection were independent predictors of longer overall survival . After case matching, a longer overall survival was found for levetiracetam use during the whole duration of the standard chemoradiation protocol .

Levetiracetam use during the whole standard chemoradiation protocol possibly improves overall survival of patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type glioblastoma . It should be considered in the antitumor strategy of future multicentric trials .

This study provides Class III evidence that in individuals with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type glioblastoma, levetiracetam use throughout the duration of standard chemotherapy is associated with longer median overall survival .
