the association between survival with isocitrate dehydrogenase wildtype glioblastomas is controversial
we investigated whether the duration of levetiracetam use during the standard chemoradiation protocol affects overall survival of patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wildtype glioblastoma
to assess the survival benefit of levetiracetam use during the standard chemoradiation protocol a cox proportional hazard model was constructed
we performed a casematched analysis between patients with levetiracetam use during the whole duration of patients with levetiracetam use part time or never
we performed a casematched analysis between patients with levetiracetam use during the whole duration of the standard chemoradiation protocol with levetiracetam use part time or never
patients with unavailable o6methylguaninedna methyltransferase promoter methylation status were excluded
a total of 460 patients were included
the median overall survival was longer in the 116 patients with levetiracetam use during the whole duration of the standard chemoradiation protocol than in the 126 patients with parttime levetiracetam use
the 218 patients who never received levetiracetam
the median overall survival was longer in the 116 patients with levetiracetam use during the whole duration of the standard chemoradiation protocol in the 218 patients
levetiracetam use during the whole duration of mgmt promoter methylation were independent predictors of longer overall survival
levetiracetam use during the whole duration of gross total tumor resection were independent predictors of longer overall survival
levetiracetam use during the whole duration of the standard chemoradiation protocol were independent predictors of longer overall survival
after case matching a longer overall survival was found for levetiracetam use during the whole duration of the standard chemoradiation protocol
levetiracetam use during the whole standard chemoradiation protocol possibly improves overall survival of patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wildtype glioblastoma
this study should be considered in the antitumor strategy of future multicentric trials
this study provides class iii evidence that in individuals with isocitrate dehydrogenase wildtype glioblastoma levetiracetam use throughout the duration of standard chemotherapy is associated with longer median overall survivalto determine the association between surgical lesions of white structures with favorable postoperative seizure outcomes
