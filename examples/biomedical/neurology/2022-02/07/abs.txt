Sport-related concussions affect millions of individuals across the United States each year, and current techniques to diagnose and monitor them rely largely on subjective measures . Our goal was to discover and validate objective, quantifiable noninvasive biomarkers with the potential to be used in sport-related concussion diagnosis .

Urine samples from a convenience series of healthy control collegiate athletes who had not sustained a concussion and athletes who sustained a concussion as diagnosed by a sports medicine physician within 7 days were collected prospectively and studied . Participants also completed an instrumented single-task gait analysis as a functional measure . Participants were recruited from a single collegiate athletic program and were over 18 years of age and were excluded if they had a concomitant injury, active psychiatric conditions, or preexisting neurologic disorders . Using Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) mass spectroscopy and ELISA, we identified and validated urinary biomarkers of concussion .



These noninvasive biomarkers, discovered in an objective and validated manner, may be useful in diagnosing and monitoring sport-related concussions in both acute phases of injury and several days after injury .
