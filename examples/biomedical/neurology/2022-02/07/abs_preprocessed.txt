sportrelated concussions affect millions of individuals across the united states each year
current techniques to monitor millions of individuals across the united states each year rely largely on subjective measures

our goal was to validate objective quantifiable noninvasive biomarkers with the potential to be used in sportrelated concussion diagnosis

a concussion and athletes who sustained a concussion as diagnosed by a sports medicine physician within 7 days
urine samples from a convenience series of healthy control collegiate athletes were collected prospectively
urine samples from a convenience series of healthy control collegiate athletes were studied
healthy control collegiate athletes who had not sustained a concussion and athletes
participants also completed an instrumented singletask gait analysis as a functional measure
participants were excluded if participants had active psychiatric conditions
participants were recruited from a single collegiate athletic program
participants were excluded if participants had a concomitant injury
participants were excluded if participants had preexisting neurologic disorders
participants were were over 18 years of age
