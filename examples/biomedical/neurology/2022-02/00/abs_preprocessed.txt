hemispatial neglect is stimulus centered neglect
hemispatial neglect is a complex disorder
hemispatial neglect is viewer centered neglect
hemispatial neglect is a heterogeneous disorder
we investigated the effect of acute stroke lesions on the connectivity of neural networks
neural networks that underlie stimulus centered neglect
neural networks that underlie viewer centered neglect
a detailed hemispatial neglect assessment that included mri
a detailed hemispatial neglect assessment that included scene copy
a detailed hemispatial neglect assessment that included oral reading
a detailed hemispatial neglect assessment that included horizontal line bisection tests
a detailed hemispatial neglect assessment that included gap detection
a total of 174 patients within 48 hours of acute right hemispheric infarct underwent a detailed hemispatial neglect assessment
a detailed hemispatial neglect assessment that included line cancellation
each patients connectivity map was generated
lesioninduced disconnections associated with the presence or severity of stimulus centered neglect
we performed a linear association analysis between network connectivity strength to identify lesioninduced disconnections
lesioninduced disconnections associated with the presence or severity of viewer centered neglect
we performed continuous measures of neglect to identify lesioninduced disconnections
results were corrected for multiple comparisons
about 42 percent of the participants with right hemisphere stroke had at least one type of neglect
tracts connecting right thalamus to other righthemispheric structures
the presence of any type of neglect was associated with lesions to tracts
tracts connecting the right inferior parietal cortex to other righthemispheric structures
tracts connecting orbitofrontal cortex to other righthemispheric structures
viewer centered neglect only was strongly associated with tracts
other brain regions and tracts connecting right frontal regions with other brain regions
tracts connecting the right putamen to other brain regions and tracts
those connecting left mesial temporal cortex to other brain regions
those connecting right mesial temporal cortex to other brain regions
the presence of both types of neglect was most strongly associated with tracts
tracts connecting the right inferior parietal cortex to other brain regions
tracts connecting the right superior parietal cortex to other brain regions
tracts connecting those
we study provides new evidence for the specific white matter tracts
the specific white matter tracts where disruption can because hemispatial neglect in a relatively large number of participants after onset
the specific white matter tracts where disruption can because hemispatial neglect in a relatively large number of homogeneous time after onset
we obtained behavioral testing acutely before the opportunity for rehabilitation recovery
we obtained mri testing acutely before the opportunity for substantial recovery
we obtained mri testing acutely before the opportunity for rehabilitation recovery
we obtained behavioral testing acutely before the opportunity for substantial recovery
our study provides class ii evidence that damage to specific white matter tracts are associated with the presence of neglect following right hemispheric stroke
