of the 6711955 study participants 128744 experienced the death of a child had a stroke during the followup
bereaved parents had an increased risk of stroke
the corresponding incidence rate ratio was 123
the association between the death of a child was present for all and did not differ substantially according to the age of the deceased child but was stronger if the parent had no or less then 3 than 1 to 2 live children at the time of the loss
all analyzed categories of causes of child death
the association between the risk of stroke was present for all and did not differ substantially according to the age of the deceased child but was stronger if the parent had no or less then 3 than 1 to 2 live children at the time of the loss
the association between the risk of stroke was similar for ischemic stroke
the association between the death of a child was similar for ischemic stroke
the association between the risk of stroke was similar for hemorrhagic stroke
the association between the death of a child was similar for hemorrhagic stroke
the risk for hemorrhagic stroke decreased afterwards
the risk for hemorrhagic stroke was highest immediately after the death of a child
in contrast there was no clear pattern over time in case of ischemic stroke
the death of a child was associated with a modestly increased risk of stroke
the finding that an association was observed in case of unnatural deaths is suggestive of the explanation that bereavementrelated stress may contribute to the development of stroke
