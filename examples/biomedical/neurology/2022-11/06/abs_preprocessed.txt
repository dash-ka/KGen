pathogenic variants in the neuronal sodium channel alpha1 subunit gene are the most frequent monogenic because of epilepsy
phenotypes comprise a wide clinical spectrum including the milder genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus
phenotypes comprise a wide clinical spectrum including dravet syndrome with febrile seizures plus
phenotypes comprise a wide clinical spectrum including severe childhood epilepsy with febrile seizures plus
early recognition of a childs risk for developing dravet syndrome versus genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus is key for implementing diseasemodifying therapies when available before cognitive impairment emerges
our objective was to validate a prediction model using clinical biomarkers for early diagnosis of neuronal sodium channel alpha1 subunit generelated epilepsies

a training cohort was used to develop multiple prediction models
multiple prediction models that were validated using 2 independent blinded cohorts
the model predicting dravet syndrome versus other genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus phenotypes
primary outcome was the discriminative accuracy of the model
a total of 1018 participants were included
the frequency of dravet syndrome was 83 percent in validation cohort 2
the frequency of dravet syndrome was 83 percent in the training cohort
the frequency of dravet syndrome was 72 percent in validation cohort 1
young age at onset were each associated with dravet syndrome with febrile seizures plus
a high neuronal sodium channel alpha1 subunit gene genetic score were each associated with genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus
a high neuronal sodium channel alpha1 subunit gene genetic score were each associated with dravet syndrome with febrile seizures plus
young age at onset were each associated with genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus
a combined neuronal sodium channel alpha1 subunit gene seizure onset model separated dravet syndrome from genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus more effectively
a combined neuronal sodium channel alpha1 subunit gene genetic score outperformed all other models
a combined neuronal sodium channel alpha1 subunit gene genetic score separated dravet syndrome from genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus more effectively
a combined neuronal sodium channel alpha1 subunit gene seizure onset model outperformed all other models
model performance was replicated in both validation cohorts 1
model performance was replicated in both 2
model allows objective estimation at disease onset whether a child will develop dravet syndrome plus assisting clinicians with prognostic counseling and decisions on early institution of precision therapies
