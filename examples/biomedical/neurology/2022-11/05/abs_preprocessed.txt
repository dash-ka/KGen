temporal lobe epilepsy undergoing anterior temporal lobectomy
risk for memory decline is a substantial concern in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy
although prior studies have identified associations between integrity of white matter networks within the medial temporal lobe preoperatively we contribute a study
a study examining whether microstructural asymmetry of deep white matter networks within the medial temporal lobe predicts postoperative memory decline
a study examining whether microstructural asymmetry of superficial white matter networks within the medial temporal lobe predicts postoperative memory decline
although prior studies have identified associations between memory of white matter networks within the medial temporal lobe preoperatively we contribute a study
all patients were recruited from 2 epilepsy centers in a prospective longitudinal study
all patients completed diffusionweighted mri
all patients completed preoperative neuropsychological testing
all patients completed postoperative neuropsychological testing
all patients completed preoperative t1
deep white matter tracts associated with memory
preoperative fractional anisotropy of the white matter directly beneath the neocortex were calculated
preoperative fractional anisotropy of the white matter of deep white matter tracts were calculated
asymmetry was examined in logistic regressions with preoperative to postoperative memory change as the primary outcome
asymmetry was calculated for hippocampal volume of each white matter tract
asymmetry was examined in linear regressions with preoperative to postoperative memory change as the primary outcome
asymmetry was calculated for fractional anisotropy of each white matter tract
asymmetry was calculated for fractional anisotropy of region
asymmetry was calculated for hippocampal volume of region
data were analyzed from 42 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy
temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy
leftward fractional anisotropy asymmetry of the entorhinal swhite matter was associated with decline on associative recall in ltemporal lobe epilepsy whereas leftward fractional anisotropy asymmetry of the uncinate fasciculus was associated with decline on prose recall only
leftward fractional anisotropy asymmetry of the entorhinal swhite matter was associated with decline on prose recall in ltemporal lobe epilepsy whereas leftward fractional anisotropy asymmetry of the uncinate fasciculus was associated with decline on prose recall only
leftward fractional anisotropy asymmetry of the entorhinal swhite matter uniquely contributed to decline in associative recall
leftward fractional anisotropy asymmetry of the entorhinal swhite matter uniquely contributed to decline in both prose
leftward fractional anisotropy asymmetry of the uncinate fasciculus uniquely contributed to decline in prose recall
after controlling for hippocampal volume
after controlling for preoperative memory score
a model combining asymmetry of hippocampal volume
a model correctly classified memory outcomes in 79 percent of patients with ltemporal lobe epilepsy for prose
a model combining asymmetry of entorhinal fractional anisotropy
a model correctly classified memory outcomes in 79 percent of patients with 81 percent of patients for associative recall
entorhinal swhite matter asymmetry was the strongest predictor in both models
swhite matter integrity within the medial temporal lobe is a strong predictor of postoperative memory decline in temporal lobe epilepsy
a strong predictor of postoperative memory decline in temporal lobe epilepsy suggesting that surgical decisionmaking may benefit from considering reserve in addition to hippocampal integrity
preoperative asymmetry of deep white matter is a strong predictor of postoperative memory decline in temporal lobe epilepsy
a strong predictor of postoperative memory decline in temporal lobe epilepsy suggesting that surgical decisionmaking may benefit from considering each patients white matter network adequacy to hippocampal integrity
