the death of a child is an extreme life event with potentially longterm health consequences
accumulating evidence suggests that parents have increased ischemic heart disease
parents who lost a child
accumulating evidence suggests that parents have increased atrial fibrillation
accumulating evidence suggests that parents have increased risks
whether bereaved parents have an increased risk of stroke was investigated in this study
whether bereaved parents have an increased risk of stroke is unclear
parents who had a child born during 1973 recorded in the danish
parents
parents who had a child born during 2014 recorded in the danish
we conducted a populationbased cohort study
parents who had a child born during 1973 recorded in the danish
the swedish medical birth registers respectively
parents who had a child born during 2016 recorded in the danish
a populationbased cohort study
we conducted
healthrelated characteristics through linkage between several populationbased registers
socioeconomic characteristics through linkage between several populationbased registers
we obtained information on child death parent stroke
we used poisson regression to examine the association between the death of a child
we used poisson regression to examine the association between the risk of stroke
of the 6711955 study participants 128744 experienced the death of 141840 had a stroke during the followup
of the 6711955 study participants 128744 experienced the death of a child had a stroke during the followup
bereaved parents had an increased risk of stroke
the corresponding incidence rate ratio was 123
the association between the death of a child was present for all and did not differ substantially according to the age of the deceased child but was stronger if the parent had no or less then 3 than 1 to 2 live children at the time of the loss
all analyzed categories of causes of child death
the association between the risk of stroke was present for all and did not differ substantially according to the age of the deceased child but was stronger if the parent had no or less then 3 than 1 to 2 live children at the time of the loss
the association between the risk of stroke was similar for ischemic stroke
the association between the death of a child was similar for ischemic stroke
the association between the risk of stroke was similar for hemorrhagic stroke
the association between the death of a child was similar for hemorrhagic stroke
the risk for hemorrhagic stroke decreased afterwards
the risk for hemorrhagic stroke was highest immediately after the death of a child
in contrast there was no clear pattern over time in case of ischemic stroke
the death of a child was associated with a modestly increased risk of stroke
the finding that an association was observed in case of unnatural deaths is suggestive of the explanation that bereavementrelated stress may contribute to the development of stroke
although the death of a child often can not be avoided an understanding of the death of a child healthrelated consequences may highlight the need for improved support and attention from family members
