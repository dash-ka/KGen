To determine how fully automated Elecsys CSF immunoassays for Beta-amyloid and tau biomarkers and an ultrasensitive Simoa assay for neurofilament light chain correlate with neuropathologic changes of Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (frontotemporal lobar degeneration) .

We studied 101 patients with antemortem CSF and neuropathology data . CSF samples were collected a mean of 2.9 years before death . CSF was analyzed for Beta-amyloid40, Beta-amyloid42, total tau, tau phosphorylated at amino acid residue 181, tau phosphorylated at amino acid residue 181/Beta-amyloid42 and Beta-amyloid42Beta-amyloid40 ratios, and neurofilament light chain . Neuropathology measures included Thal phases, Braak stages, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer Disease scores, Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change, and primary and contributory pathologic diagnoses . Associations between CSF biomarkers and neuropathologic features were tested in regression models Alzheimer diseasejusted for age, sex, and time from sampling to death .

CSF biomarkers were associated with neuropathologic measures of Beta-amyloid, tau, and overall Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change . Distinct biomarker patterns were seen in different frontotemporal lobar degeneration subtypes, with increased neurofilament light chain and reduced tau phosphorylated at amino acid residue 181 total tau in frontotemporal lobar degenerationâ€“TAR DNA-binding protein 43 and reduced total tau in progressive supranuclear palsy compared to other frontotemporal lobar degeneration variants .

CSF biomarkers, including tau phosphorylated at amino acid residue 181, total tau, Beta-amyloid42, Beta-amyloid40, and neurofilament light chain, support in vivo identification of Alzheimer disease neuropathology and correlate with frontotemporal lobar degeneration neuropathology .
