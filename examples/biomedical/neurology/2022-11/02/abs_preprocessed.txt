our objectives were to estimate transition rates from mild cognitive impairment to normal cognition and dementia and determine progression using multistate markov modeling
our objectives were to estimate transition rates from mild cognitive impairment to normal cognition and dementia and determine apoe markov modeling
our objectives were to estimate transition rates from mild cognitive impairment to normal cognition and dementia and determine the effect of age markov modeling
our objectives were to estimate transition rates from mild cognitive impairment to normal cognition and dementia and determine indicators of cognitive reserve on the relative rate of reversion markov modeling
we estimated instantaneous transition rates between mild cognitive impairment after accounting for transition to death across up to 12 assessments in the nun study a cohort study of religious sisters
religious sisters aged over 75 years
we estimated instantaneous transition rates between normal cognition after accounting for transition to death across up to 12 assessments in the nun study a cohort study of religious sisters
we estimated instantaneous transition rates between dementia after accounting for transition to death across up to 12 assessments in the nun study a cohort study of religious sisters
we estimated written language skills
we estimated relative rates of reversion vs progression for age such as education
we estimated relative rates of reversion vs progression for apoe such as education
we estimated relative rates of reversion vs progression for potential cognitive reserve indicators such as education
we estimated academic performanormal cognitione
of the 619 participants 472 were assessed with mild cognitive impairment during the study period
models adjusted for age group and apoe
in models higher levels of education more than doubled the relative rate ratio of reversion
in models higher levels of education more than doubled the relative rate ratio of progression
novel cognitive reserve indicators were significantly associated with a higher adjusted relative rate of reversion
novel cognitive reserve indicators were significantly associated with a higher adjusted relative rate of progression
knowledge of frequent reversion from mild cognitive impairment to normal cognition may alleviate conormal cognitionerns of inevitable cognitive decline in those with mild cognitive impairment
identification of characteristics may guide populationlevel interventions targeting these characteristics to prevent mild cognitive impairment and dementia
characteristics predicting the rate of reversion from mild cognitive impairment to normal cognition to dementia
identification of characteristics may guide populationlevel interventions targeting these characteristics to postpone mild cognitive impairment and dementia
characteristics predicting progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia
research on cognitive trajectories would benefit from competing events such as death into statistical modeling
research on cognitive trajectories would benefit from inormal cognitionorporating predictors of reverse transitions into statistical modeling
these results may inform the design and interpretation of mild cognitive impairment clinical trials given that a substantial proportion of participants may experienormal cognitione improvement without intervention
