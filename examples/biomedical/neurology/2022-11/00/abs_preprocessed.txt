the care of patients with large vessel occlusion stroke has been revolutionized by endovascular thrombectomy
most patients treated with endovascular thrombectomy
while endovascular thrombectomy has a large effect size most patients remain die within 90 days
while endovascular thrombectomy has a large effect size most patients remain disabled
a better understanding of outcomes may influence novel therapies
a better understanding of outcomes may influence prognostication
a better understanding of outcomes may influence endovascular thrombectomy selection criteria
outcomes involved in ischemic lesions
we sought to identify associations between brain regions
we sought to identify associations between outcomes
brain regions involved in ischemic lesions
for this cohort study mri were identified from a tertiary referral center
large vessel occlusion who were treated with endovascular thrombectomy
large vessel occlusion who underwent postendovascular thrombectomy
for consecutive patients with large vessel occlusion mri were identified from a tertiary referral center
acute ischemic lesions were manually segmented from diffusionweighted imaging
acute ischemic lesions normalized
individual lesions were parcellated to 10 essential lesion patterns with the use of unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques
individual lesions were reduced to 10 essential lesion patterns with the use of unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques
ninetyday was modeled via bayesian regression controlling for acute nih stroke scale score
ninetyday was modeled via bayesian regression controlling for lesion size
ninetyday was modeled via bayesian regression controlling for prior stroke
ninetyday was modeled via bayesian regression controlling for good reperfusion
ninetyday was modeled via bayesian regression controlling for alteplase
ninetyday was modeled via bayesian regression taking the 10 lesion patterns as inputs
ninetyday was modeled via bayesian regression controlling for intracerebral hemorrhage
ninetyday modified rankin scale score
ninetyday was modeled via bayesian regression controlling for age
ninetyday was modeled via bayesian regression controlling for sex
in comparative analyses compartmentwise relevances for acute stroke severity were evaluated
in comparative analyses 90day were evaluated
in comparative analyses 90day modified rankin scale score were evaluated
90day modified rankin scale score was modeled considering covariates only
large vessel occlusion identified
there were 151 patients with large vessel occlusion
the median nih stroke scale score was 16
the simpler model relying on covariates only
the lesion location model outperformed the simpler model
lesions affecting white matter tracts
lesions affecting subcortical nuclei
90day modified rankin scale score
while lesions had the highest relevance for stroke severity lesions had the highest relevance for 90day
the highest relevance for 90day modified rankin scale score describe the significance for outcomes of specific brain regions involved in ischemic lesions on postendovascular thrombectomy mri after endovascular thrombectomy
future work in additional datasets is needed to confirm these granular findings
