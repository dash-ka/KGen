aboriginal australians are disproportionately affected by dementia with incidence in remote populations approximately double that of nonindigenous populations
this study aimed to identify dementia incidence in aboriginal australians
this study aimed to identify risk factors in aboriginal australians
urban areas which are currently unknown
aboriginal australians residing in urban areas
a populationbased cohort of aboriginal australians over 60 years of age was assessed at baseline
a populationbased cohort of aboriginal australians over 60 years of age was assessed at 6year followup
lifecourse risk factors were examined for mild cognitive impairment through logistic regression analyses
lifecourse risk factors were examined for incident dementia through logistic regression analyses
apoe genotyping was available for 86 people
data were included from 155 participants 60 to 86 years of age
there were 16 incident dementia cases mild cognitive impairment
there were 36 combined incident dementia cases
there were 16 incident dementia cases dementia cases
there were 36 combined incident mild cognitive impairment
polypharmacy were associated with dementia in the final model
past smoking were associated with dementia in the final model
male sex were associated with dementia in the final model
male sex were associated with incident mild cognitive impairment in the final model
past smoking were associated with incident mild cognitive impairment in the final model
unskilled work history were associated with dementia in the final model
polypharmacy were associated with incident mild cognitive impairment in the final model
unskilled work history were associated with incident mild cognitive impairment in the final model
older age were associated with incident mild cognitive impairment in the final model
older age were associated with dementia in the final model
apoe epsilon4 allele frequency was 24 percent
homozygous epsilon4 was associated with dementia
heterozygous epsilon4 was associated with dementia
homozygous epsilon4 was associated with incident mild cognitive impairment
heterozygous epsilon4 was associated with incident mild cognitive impairment
dementia provide evidence for higher dementia incidence in aboriginal australians from urban areas
incident mild cognitive impairment provide evidence for higher dementia incidence in aboriginal australians from urban areas
urban areas where the majority of aboriginal people reside
this population which is critical for targeted prevention strategies
this study also sheds light on sociodemographic
genetic factors associated with incident mild cognitive impairment at older ages in this population
this study also sheds health
genetic factors associated with dementia at older ages in this population
this study also sheds genetic factors
