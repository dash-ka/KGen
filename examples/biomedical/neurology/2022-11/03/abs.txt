Aboriginal Australians are disproportionately affected by dementia, with incidence in remote populations approximately double that of non-Indigenous populations . This study aimed to identify dementia incidence and risk factors in Aboriginal Australians residing in urban areas, which are currently unknown .

A population-based cohort of Aboriginal Australians over 60 years of age was assessed at baseline and 6-year follow-up . Life-course risk factors were examined for incident dementia or mild cognitive impairment through logistic regression analyses. APOE genotyping was available for 86 people .

Data were included from 155 participants 60 to 86 years of age . There were 16 incident dementia cases and 36 combined incident mild cognitive impairment and dementia cases . Older age, male sex, unskilled work history, polypharmacy, and past smoking were associated with incident mild cognitive impairment and dementia in the final model . APOE Epsilon4 allele frequency was 24 percent. heterozygous or homozygous Epsilon4 was associated with incident mild cognitive impairment and dementia .

These findings provide evidence for higher dementia incidence in Aboriginal Australians from urban areas, where the majority of Aboriginal people reside . This study also sheds light on sociodemographic, health, and genetic factors associated with incident mild cognitive impairment and dementia at older ages in this population, which is critical for targeted prevention strategies .
