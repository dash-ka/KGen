To evaluate costs and health-related quality of life of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodyâ€“associated disease .

In this multicenter cross-sectional study, data on consumption of medical and nonmedical resources and work ability were assessed via patient questionnaires . Costs were analyzed in Euros for 2018 from the societal perspective . health-related quality of life was captured by the EuroQoL Group 5 Dimension 5 Level Scale questionnaire . Clinical data were retrieved from the Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group database .

Two hundred twelve patients were analyzed . The mean total annual per capita cost of illness accounted for 59,574 euros . The most important cost drivers were informal care costs, indirect costs, and drugs, especially immunotherapeutics . Costs showed a positive correlation with disease severity . The health-related quality of life revealed a negative correlation to disease severity . Neither antibody status nor disease duration influenced the total annual costs or health-related quality of life .

These German data from the era without approved preventive immunotherapies show enormous effects of the diseases on costs and quality of life . An early and cost-effective therapy should be provided to prevent long-term disability and to preserve quality of life .
