The goal of this work was to investigate the association between group A streptococcal infections and tic incidence among unaffected children with a family history of chronic tic disorders .

In a prospective cohort study, children with no history for tics who were 3 to 10 years of age with a first-degree relative with a chronic tic disorder were recruited from the European Multicentre Tics in Children Study across 16 European centers . Presence of group A streptococcal infection was assessed with throat swabs, serum antiâ€“streptolysin O titers, and anti-DNAse titers blinded to clinical status . group A streptococcal exposure was defined with 4 different definitions based on these parameters . Cox regression analyses with time-varying group A streptococcal exposure were conducted to examine the association of onset of tics and group A streptococcal exposure during follow-up . Sensitivity analyses were conducted with Cox regression and logistic regression analyses .

A total of 259 children were recruited. 1 child was found to have tic onset before study entry and therefore was excluded . Sixty-one children developed tics over an average follow-up period of 1 year . There was a strong association of sex and onset of tics, with girls having an aproximately 60 percent lower risk of developing tics compared to boys . However, there was no statistical evidence to suggest an association of any of the 4 group A streptococcal exposure definitions with tic onset .

These results do not suggest an association between group A streptococcal exposure and development of tics .
