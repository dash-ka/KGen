the goal of this work was to investigate tic incidence among unaffected children with a family history of chronic tic disorders
the goal of this work was to investigate the association between group a streptococcal infections with a family history of chronic tic disorders
tics who were 3 to 10 years of age with a firstdegree relative with a chronic tic disorder
in a prospective cohort study children with no history for tics were recruited from the european multicentre tics in children study across 16 european centers
presence of group a streptococcal infection was assessed with throat swabs serum antistreptolysin o titers
antidnase titers blinded to clinical status
4 different definitions based on these parameters
group a streptococcal exposure was defined with 4 different definitions
cox regression analyses with timevarying group a streptococcal exposure were conducted to examine the association of group a streptococcal exposure during followup
cox regression analyses with timevarying group a streptococcal exposure were conducted to examine the association of onset of tics during followup
sensitivity analyses were conducted with cox regression
sensitivity analyses were conducted with logistic regression analyses
a total of 259 children were recruited
1 child was found to have tic onset before study entry
1 child therefore was excluded
sixtyone children developed tics over an average followup period of 1 year
there was a strong association of onset of tics with girls
girls having an aproximately 60 percent lower risk of developing tics compared to boys
there was a strong association of sex of tics with girls
however there was no statistical evidence to suggest an association of any of the 4 group a streptococcal exposure definitions with tic onset
these results do not suggest development of tics
these results do not suggest an association between group a streptococcal exposure
