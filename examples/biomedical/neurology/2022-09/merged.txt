higher csf betaamyloid38 levels are associated with lower risk of alzheimer diseaserelated changes in 2 independent clinical cohorts
these findings suggest that gammasecretase modulators could be effective as diseasealtering therapyaducanumab was granted accelerated approval with a conflicting evidence base vote to reject approval
aducanumab was granted accelerated approval with drug administration advisory committee vote to reject approval
aducanumab was granted accelerated approval with nearunanimous food vote to reject approval
aducanumab was granted accelerated approval with a widely criticized launch price of  56000 per year
the objective of this analysis was to estimate this analysis costeffectiveness
this analysis developed a markov model to compare aducanumab in addition to supportive care to supportive care alone over a lifetime horizon
results were modified societal perspective
results were presented from both the health system
a markov model tracked the severity of disease
a markov model tracked the severity of the care setting
incremental costeffectiveness ratios were calculated
a threshold analysis was conducted to estimate at what price aducanumab would meet commonly used costeffectiveness thresholds
using estimates of effectiveness based on pooling of data from both pivotal trials patients treated with aducanumab
aducanumab spent 4 more months in earlier stages of alzheimer disease
over the lifetime time horizon treating a patient with aducanumab results in 0154 more qualityadjusted lifeyears gained per patient gained per patient from the health care system perspective with additional costs of approximately  204000 per patient
over the lifetime time horizon treating a patient with aducanumab results in 0154 more qualityadjusted lifeyears gained 0201 equal value of lifeyears gained per patient from the health care system perspective with additional costs of approximately  204000 per patient
the incremental outcomes were similar for the modified societal perspective
at the launch price of  56000 per year the costeffectiveness ranged from  102 million per equal value of lifeyears gained to  133 million per qualityadjusted lifeyear
at the launch price of  56000 per year the costeffectiveness ranged from  102 million per equal value of lifeyears from  938000 per equal value of lifeyears gained to  127 million per qualityadjusted lifeyear
qualityadjusted lifeyear gained in the modified societal perspective
 133 million per qualityadjusted lifeyear gained from the health care system perspective
 2950 to  8360 which represents a discount of 85 percent to 95 percent off from the annual launch price set by the manufacturer
the annual price to meet commonly used costeffectiveness thresholds ranged from  2950 to  8360
using estimates of effectiveness based only on the trial the mean incremental cost was greater than  400000 per qualityadjusted lifeyear gained
the trial that suggested a benefit
patients received minimal improvements in health outcomes at considerable cost
patients treated with aducanumab
this resulted in incremental costeffectiveness ratios even under optimistic treatment effectiveness assumptions
incremental costeffectiveness ratios that far exceeded commonly used value thresholds
the substantial uncertainty regarding whether aducanumab provides any true net health benefit
evidence available currently suggests that an annual price of aducanumab of  56000 is not in reasonable alignment with aducanumab of  56000 clinical benefits
these findings are subject to the substantial uncertainty
