genetic white matter disorders are of heterogeneous origin with over 100 causal genes
100 causal genes identified to date
classic targeted approaches achieve a molecular diagnosis in only half of all patients
we aimed to determine the clinical utility of singleton wholeexome sequencing
wholegenome sequencing interpreted with a interactomedriven prioritization algorithm to diagnose genetic white matter disorders while identifying candidate genes

a case series of patients of all ages with undiagnosed genetic white matter disorders despite extensive standardofcare paraclinical studies were december 2019 in a collaborative study at the bellvitge biomedical research institute
a case series of patients of all ages with undiagnosed genetic white matter disorders despite extensive standardofcare paraclinical studies were december 2019 in neurology units of tertiary spanish hospitals
a case series of patients of all ages with undiagnosed genetic white matter disorders despite extensive standardofcare paraclinical studies were recruited between april 2017
we ran wgs
we applied we interactomeprioritization algorithm based on the network expansion of a seed group of genetic white matter disordersrelated genes derived from the human phenotype ontology terms of each patient
we ran swes
ages ranging from 1 month to 74 years
we evaluated 126 patients with ages
cases which reached 72 percent after wgs was performed in 16 of the remaining negative cases
we obtained a first molecular diagnosis by singleton wholeexome sequencing in 59 percent of cases
cases which increased to 68 percent after annual reanalysis
we identified variants in 57 different genes among 91 diagnosed these cases with the most frequent being a dual diagnosis underlying complex phenotypes in 6 families underscoring the importance of genomic analysis to solve these cases
we identified variants in 57 different genes among 91 diagnosed these cases with the most frequent being rnaseh2b eif2b5 polr3a phenotypes in 6 families underscoring the importance of genomic analysis to solve these cases
we identified variants in 57 different genes among 91 diagnosed these cases with the most frequent being plp1 phenotypes in 6 families underscoring the importance of genomic analysis to solve these cases
we propose additional putative novel candidate genes for yettobe
we discovered 9 candidate genes causing novel diseases
yettobe discovered genetic white matter disorders
we strategy enables a high diagnostic yield
we strategy is wholegenome sequencing for genetic white matter disorders
we strategy is a good alternative to trio wholeexome sequencing
the classical targeted approach thus optimizing appropriate management
our strategy shortens the time to diagnosis compared to the classical
etiopathogenic mechanisms that are pivotal for myelin generation and maintenance
furthermore the interactomedriven prioritization pipeline enables the discovery of novel diseasecausing genes and predicts novel putative candidate genes shedding light on etiopathogenic mechanisms
