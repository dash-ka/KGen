experimental studies suggest that the balance between long betaamyloid species might modulate the toxic effects of betaamyloid in the alzheimers disease
clinical evidence is lacking
experimental studies suggest that the balance between short betaamyloid species might modulate the toxic effects of betaamyloid in the alzheimers disease
we studied whether betaamyloid38 levels in csf relate to risk of cognitive decline
we studied whether betaamyloid38 levels in csf relate to risk of alzheimer disease dementia
csf betaamyloid38 levels were measured in 656 individuals across 2 clinical cohorts
the swedish biofinder study
the swedish biofinder the alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative
cox regression models were used to evaluate the association between baseline betaamyloid38 levels with subjective cognitive decline
cox regression models were used to evaluate risk of alzheimer disease dementia in alzheimer disease biomarkerpositive individuals with mild cognitive impairment
cox regression models were used to evaluate risk of alzheimer disease dementia in alzheimer disease biomarkerpositive individuals with subjective cognitive decline
cox regression models were used to evaluate the association between baseline betaamyloid38 levels with mild cognitive impairment
cognitive decline as measured by the minimental state examination in alzheimer disease participants with alzheimer disease dementia
linear mixedeffects models were used to evaluate cognitive decline as
cognitive decline as measured by the minimental state examination in alzheimer disease participants with mild cognitive impairment
cognitive decline as measured by the minimental state examination in alzheimer disease participants with subjective cognitive decline
linear mixedeffects models were used to evaluate the association between baseline betaamyloid38 levels
in the biofinder cohort high betaamyloid38 levels were associated with lower risk of conversion to alzheimer disease dementia
in the biofinder cohort high betaamyloid38 levels were associated with slower decline in minimental state examination score to alzheimer disease dementia
the alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative cohort
in the alzheimers disease higher betaamyloid38 levels were associated with less decline in minimental state examination score to alzheimer disease dementia
in the alzheimers disease higher betaamyloid38 levels were associated with risk of conversion to alzheimer disease dementia
betaamyloid38 levels in both cohorts were significantly associated with both clinical outcomes when further alzheimer diseasejusted for csf betaamyloid42 levels
betaamyloid38 levels in both cohorts were significantly associated with both cognitive outcomes when further alzheimer diseasejusted for csf ptau
betaamyloid38 levels in both cohorts were significantly associated with both cognitive outcomes when further alzheimer diseasejusted for csf betaamyloid42 levels
betaamyloid38 levels in both cohorts were significantly associated with both clinical outcomes when further alzheimer diseasejusted for csf ptau
higher csf betaamyloid38 levels are associated with lower risk of alzheimer diseaserelated changes in 2 independent clinical cohorts
these findings suggest that gammasecretase modulators could be effective as diseasealtering therapy
