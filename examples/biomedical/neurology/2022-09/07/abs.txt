Experimental studies suggest that the balance between short and long Beta-amyloid species might modulate the toxic effects of Beta-amyloid in Alzheimer disease, but clinical evidence is lacking . We studied whether Beta-amyloid38 levels in CSF relate to risk of Alzheimer disease dementia and cognitive decline .

CSF Beta-amyloid38 levels were measured in 656 individuals across 2 clinical cohorts . the Swedish BioFINDER study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative . Cox regression models were used to evaluate the association between baseline Beta-amyloid38 levels and risk of Alzheimer disease dementia in Alzheimer disease biomarkerâ€“positive individuals with subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment . Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the association between baseline Beta-amyloid38 levels and cognitive decline as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination in Alzheimer disease+ participants with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer disease dementia .

In the BioFINDER cohort, high Beta-amyloid38 levels were associated with slower decline in Mini-Mental State Examination score and with lower risk of conversion to Alzheimer disease dementia . In the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative  cohort, higher Beta-amyloid38 levels were associated with less decline in Mini-Mental State Examination score but not risk of conversion to Alzheimer disease dementia . Beta-amyloid38 levels in both cohorts were significantly associated with both cognitive and clinical outcomes when further Alzheimer diseasejusted for CSF P-tau or CSF Beta-amyloid42 levels .

Higher CSF Beta-amyloid38 levels are associated with lower risk of Alzheimer disease-related changes in 2 independent clinical cohorts . These findings suggest that gamma-secretase modulators could be effective as disease-altering therapy .
