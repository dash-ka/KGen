participants underwent cognitive evaluation brain mri to measure the basal forebrain volume to measure the standardized uptake value ratio
participants underwent cognitive evaluation brain mri to measure global cortical thickness to measure the standardized uptake value ratio
participants underwent cognitive evaluation brain mri to measure 18fflorbetaben pet to measure the standardized uptake value ratio
using path analyses we evaluated the association of basal forebrain volume with cognitive dysfunormal controlstion in lewy body disease spectrum respectively
using general linear models we evaluated the association of 18fflorbetabenstandardized uptake value ratio with cortical thickness in the alzheimer disease spectrum respectively
