disease control rates were calculated using the dersimonianlaird method based on randomeffects modeling
the pooled objective response rates were calculated using the dersimonianlaird method based on randomeffects modeling
the pooled proportion of adverse events was also calculated
the quality of the evidence was assessed using the grading of evaluation system
the quality of the evidence was assessed using the grading of development
the quality of the evidence was assessed using the grading of recommendations
the quality of the evidence was assessed using the grading of assessment
five studies were included in our analysis
five studies involving 126 patients
five studies involving 126 patients
five studies had a very low to moderate quality of the evidence
the pooled objective response rate was the disease control rate was 925 percent
