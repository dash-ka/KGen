this retrospective crosssectional study have shown gender disparities in physician pay in various specialties
this retrospective crosssectional study evaluated data from productivity survey for differences in neurologist compensation by gender
this retrospective crosssectional study evaluated data from the american academy of neurology compensation by gender
of the 3268 completed surveys submitted 2719 were from neurologists had sufficient data for analysis
of the 3268 completed surveys submitted 2719 were from 1466 had sufficient data for analysis
we calculated an hourly wage from fulltime equivalent status
weeks worked per year
linear models adjusting for ethnicity

we evaluated differences in women neurologist compensation with multivariable
we evaluated differences in men with multivariable
baseline characteristics for women neurologists were similar with the exception of subspecialty distribution
baseline characteristics for men were similar with the exception of subspecialty distribution
more men were practicing in higherwage subspecialties compared to women
this retrospective crosssectional study using convenience sample data
this retrospective crosssectional study adds to the existing body of evidence
evidence demonstrating that despite adjustment for multiple confounding variables ongoing disparities exist in physician compensation
despite efforts by professional societies such as the american academy of neurology ongoing systemic issues exist
despite efforts by professional societies such as the american academy of neurology barriers exist
further research into underlying causes is recommended
further research into mitigation strategies is recommended
use of probability sampling methods in future research will be important to increase generalizability
use of probability sampling methods in future research will be important to decrease potential bias
