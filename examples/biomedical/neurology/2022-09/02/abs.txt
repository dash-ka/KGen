Neurofilament light chain in blood is a sensitive but nonspecific marker of brain injury . This study sought to evaluate associations between Neurofilament light chain concentration and MRI findings of vascular brain injury in older adults .

A longitudinal cohort study included 2 cranial MRI scans performed about 5 years apart and assessed for white matter hyperintensities and infarcts . About 1 year before their second MRI, 1,362 participants without a history of TIA or stroke had measurement Neurofilament light chain, total tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 . Most also had the first MRI scan, and some had quantitative measurements of hippocampal and white matter hyperintensities . In primary analyses, we assessed associations of Neurofilament light chain with a 10-point white matter grade and prevalent infarcts on second MRI and with worsening white matter grade and incident infarct comparing the 2 scans . We also assessed associations with hippocampal and white matter hyperintensities volume .

In fully adjusted models, Neurofilament light chain concentration was associated with white matter grade and worsening white matter grade, but less strongly with prevalent brain infarcts and not with incident brain infarcts . Associations were also present with white matter hyperintensities volume . For the other 3 biomarkers, the associations for glial fibrillary acidic protein concentration with white matter grade and worsening white matter grade were significant .

Among older adults without a history of stroke, higher serum Neurofilament light chain concentration was associated with covert MRI findings of vascular brain injury, especially the burden of white matter hyperintensities and its worsening . Whether these results offer opportunities for the use of Neurofilament light chain as a noninvasive biomarker of white matter hyperintensities or to control vascular risk factors remains to be determined .
