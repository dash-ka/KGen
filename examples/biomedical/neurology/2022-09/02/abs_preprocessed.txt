neurofilament light chain in blood is a sensitive marker of brain injury
neurofilament light chain in blood is a nonspecific marker of brain injury
neurofilament light chain in blood sought to evaluate mri findings of vascular brain injury in older adults
neurofilament light chain in blood sought to evaluate associations between neurofilament light chain concentration
a longitudinal cohort study included 2 cranial mri scans performed about 5 years apart
a longitudinal cohort study included 2 cranial mri scans assessed for white matter hyperintensities and infarcts
about 1 year before their second mri 1362 participants without a history of stroke had total tau glial fibrillary acidic protein
about 1 year before their second mri 1362 participants without a history of tia had measurement neurofilament light chain
about 1 year before their second mri 1362 participants without a history of tia had total tau glial fibrillary acidic protein
about 1 year before their second mri 1362 participants without a history of tia had ubiquitin carboxylterminal hydrolase l1
about 1 year before their second mri 1362 participants without a history of stroke had measurement neurofilament light chain
about 1 year before their second mri 1362 participants without a history of stroke had ubiquitin carboxylterminal hydrolase l1
some had quantitative measurements of white matter hyperintensities
some had quantitative measurements of hippocampal matter hyperintensities
most also had 2 cranial mri scan
in primary analyses we assessed associations of neurofilament light chain with prevalent infarcts on 2 cranial mri
in primary analyses we assessed associations of neurofilament light chain with prevalent infarcts with worsening white matter grade
incident infarct comparing the 2 scans
in primary analyses we assessed associations of neurofilament light chain with a 10point white matter grade with incident infarct
in primary analyses we assessed associations of neurofilament light chain with prevalent infarcts with incident infarct
in primary analyses we assessed associations of neurofilament light chain with a 10point white matter grade on 2 cranial mri
in primary analyses we assessed associations of neurofilament light chain with a 10point white matter grade with worsening white matter grade
worsening white matter grade comparing the 2 scans
we also assessed associations with white matter hyperintensities volume
we also assessed associations with hippocampal
in fully adjusted models neurofilament light chain concentration was associated with worsening white matter grade but less strongly with incident brain infarcts
in fully adjusted models neurofilament light chain concentration was associated with white matter grade grade but less strongly with incident brain infarcts
in fully adjusted models neurofilament light chain concentration was associated with white matter grade grade but less strongly with prevalent brain infarcts
in fully adjusted models neurofilament light chain concentration was associated with worsening white matter grade but less strongly with prevalent brain infarcts
associations were also present with white matter hyperintensities volume
for the other 3 biomarkers the associations for glial fibrillary acidic protein concentration with worsening white matter grade were significant
for the other 3 biomarkers the associations for glial fibrillary acidic protein concentration with white matter grade grade were significant
among older adults without a history of stroke higher serum neurofilament light chain concentration was associated with covert mri findings of white matter hyperintensities worsening
among older adults without a history of stroke higher serum neurofilament light chain concentration was associated with covert mri findings of vascular brain injury worsening
among older adults without a history of stroke higher serum neurofilament light chain concentration was associated with covert mri findings of especially the burden of white matter hyperintensities worsening
whether these results offer opportunities for the use of neurofilament light chain as a noninvasive biomarker of white matter hyperintensities remains to be determined
whether these results offer opportunities for to control vascular risk factors remains to be determined
