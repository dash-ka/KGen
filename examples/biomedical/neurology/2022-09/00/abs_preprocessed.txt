hispanic people with multiple sclerosis have been found to have worse outcomes associated with multiple sclerosis compared to white people with multiple sclerosis
hispanic people with multiple sclerosis have been found to have different disease courses outcomes associated with multiple sclerosis compared to white people with multiple sclerosis
black people with multiple sclerosis have been found to have different disease courses outcomes associated with multiple sclerosis compared to white people with multiple sclerosis
black people with multiple sclerosis have been found to have worse outcomes associated with multiple sclerosis compared to white people with multiple sclerosis
hispanic people with multiple sclerosis are also more likely to be negatively affected by social determinants of health further worsening disparities in outcomes
black people with multiple sclerosis are also more likely to be negatively affected by social determinants of health further worsening disparities in outcomes
as these disparities may affect treatment response nonwhite people with multiple sclerosis must be included in trials for greater generalizability of research treatment plans
as these disparities may affect treatment response nonwhite people with multiple sclerosis must be included in trials for therefore more inclusive treatment plans
in this study we aimed to evaluate how race are reported in medical journals

14 reported more races and ethnicities
14 reported 2 races and ethnicities
when compared to multinational census data nonwhite people with multiple sclerosis were significantly underrepresented in multiple sclerosis trials
due to lack of data trends in representation of other races and ethnicities could not be assessed
race are underreported in race
ethnicity are underreported in race
ethnic representation are omitted from manufacturer websites
race are underreported in multiple sclerosis dmt trial publications
ethnicity are underreported in multiple sclerosis dmt trial publications
when available data show that nonwhite people with multiple sclerosis are significantly underrepresented in multiple sclerosis trials
the availability of this information is crucial for patients together with patients health care providers to make informed decisions about patients care
