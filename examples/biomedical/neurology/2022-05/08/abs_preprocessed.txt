to evaluate the immunespecific response after full severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination of patients with multiple sclerosis treated with different diseasemodifying drugs by the detection of both serologic responses
2 parallel prospective studies conducted in rome italy at san camillo forlanini hospital
healthcare workers having completed the 2dose schedule of an mrnabased vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the past 24 weeks
patients with multiple sclerosis were enrolled from 2 parallel prospective studies
patients with multiple sclerosis having completed the 2dose schedule of an mrnabased vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the past 24 weeks
2 parallel prospective studies conducted in rome italy at the national institute for infectious diseases spallanzaniircss
healthcare workers were enrolled from 2 parallel prospective studies
serologic response was evaluated by quantifying the regionbinding domain
serologic response was evaluated by neutralizing antibodies
cellmediated response was analyzed by a wholeblood test
a wholeblood test quantifying interferongamma response to spike peptides
cells responding to spike stimulation
cells were identified by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis
186 vaccinated individuals
we prospectively enrolled 186
twentyeight patients with multiple sclerosis were treated with 20 with cladribine
twentyeight patients with multiple sclerosis were treated with interferonbeta
twentyeight patients with multiple sclerosis were treated with 25 with ocrelizumab
twentyeight patients with multiple sclerosis were treated with 35 with fingolimod
a lower antiregionbinding domain antibody response rate was found in patients treated with interferonbeta
a lower antiregionbinding domain antibody response rate was found in patients treated with cladribine
patients treated with ocrelizumab compared to healthcare workers and patients
patients treated with fingolimod compared to healthcare workers and patients
cladribine compared to healthcare workers and patients treated with interferonbeta
patients treated with ocrelizumab
antiregionbinding domain antibody median titer was lower in patients
all the healthcare workers tested
serum neutralizing activity was present in only a minority of the fingolimodtreated patients
serum neutralizing activity was present in all the healthcare workers
tcellspecific response was detected in the majority of patients with multiple sclerosis albeit with significantly lower interferongamma levels compared to healthcare workers
the lowest frequency of tcell response was found in patients
patients treated with fingolimod
tcellspecific response correlated with antiregionbinding domain antibody titer
tcellspecific response correlated with lymphocyte count
interferongamma tcell response was mediated by both cd4
interferongamma tcell response was mediated by both cd8 t cells
mrna vaccines induce both humoral specific immune responses against spike peptides in the majority of patients with multiple sclerosis
mrna vaccines induce both cellmediated specific immune responses against spike peptides in all healthcare workers
mrna vaccines induce both humoral specific immune responses against spike peptides in all healthcare workers
mrna vaccines induce both cellmediated specific immune responses against spike peptides in the majority of patients with multiple sclerosis
mrna vaccines carry relevant implications for managing vaccinations suggesting promoting vaccination in all
all treated patients with multiple sclerosis
mrna vaccines provides class iii data that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 mrna vaccination induces both humoral specific immune responses against viral spike proteins in a majority of patients with multiple sclerosis
