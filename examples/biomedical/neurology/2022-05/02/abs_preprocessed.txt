low buffy coat mitochondrial dna copy number is associated with incident risk of stroke mortality however its prognostic utility has not been extensively explored
low buffy coat mitochondrial dna copy number is associated with incident risk of poststroke mortality however its prognostic utility prognostic utility has not been extensively explored
poststroke outcomes using epidemiologic studies
our goal was to investigate whether low buffy coat mitochondrial dna copy number is a marker determinant of poststroke outcomes
our goal was to investigate whether low buffy coat mitochondrial dna copy number is a causal determinant of poststroke outcomes
poststroke outcomes using genetic studies
first our performed association testing between baseline buffy coat mitochondrial dna copy number measurements from the international multicenter casecontrol study importance of conventional risk factors of ethnic groups of the world
first our performed association testing between baseline buffy coat mitochondrial dna copy number measurements from the international multicenter casecontrol study importance of conventional risk factors of stroke in different regions
first our performed association testing between 1month poststroke outcomes in 3498 cases of acute first stroke from 25 countries from the international multicenter casecontrol study importance of conventional risk factors of stroke in different regions

3month modified rankin scale score
then our performed 2sample mendelian randomization analyses to evaluate potential causative effects of low mitochondrial dna copy number on 3month
corresponding effects on 3month were ascertained from the genetics of ischemic stroke functional outcome study
3month modified rankin scale score
genetic variants associated with mitochondrial dna copy number levels
genetic variants were derived from the uk biobank study
a 1sd lower mitochondrial dna copy number at baseline was associated with stroke severity
independently of baseline stroke severity lower mitochondrial dna copy number was associated with poor functional outcome status
independently of baseline stroke severity lower mitochondrial dna copy number was associated with increased odds of greater 1month disability
independently of baseline stroke severity lower mitochondrial dna copy number was associated with mortality
subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent effects across stroke type
subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent effects across age
subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent effects across sex
subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent effects across country income level
subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent effects across education level
in addition mitochondrial dna copy number significantly improved reclassification of poor functional outcome status and mortality beyond known prognosticators
with the use of independent datasets mendelian randomization revealed that a 1sd decrease in genetically determined mitochondrial dna copy number was associated with increased odds of greater 3month disability
greater 3month disability quantified by ordinal modified rankin scale score
greater 3month disability quantified by poor functional outcome status
poststroke prognosis that may also be a causal determinant of poststroke outcomes
buffy coat mitochondrial dna copy number is a robust marker of poststroke prognosis
buffy coat mitochondrial dna copy number is a novel marker of poststroke prognosis
the uk biobank study provides class ii evidence that low buffy coat mitochondrial dna copy number was associated with worse baseline severity in patients with hemorrhagic stroke
the uk biobank study provides class ii evidence that low buffy coat mitochondrial dna copy number was associated with worse baseline severity in patients with ischemic stroke
the uk biobank study provides class ii evidence that low buffy coat mitochondrial dna copy number was associated with 1month outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke
