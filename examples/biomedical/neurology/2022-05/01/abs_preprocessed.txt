delayed cerebral ischemia is the leading complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage
because delayed cerebral ischemia was traditionally thought to be caused by large vessel vasospasm transcranial doppler ultrasounds have been the standard of care
continuous eeg predicts increpileptiform abnormalitiesed delayed cerebral ischemia risk
continuous eeg has emerged as a promising complementary monitoring modality
our objective was to determine whether combining eeg doppler ultrasound data improves prediction of delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage
our objective was to determine whether combining transcranial doppler ultrasound data improves prediction of delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage
our hypothesize that integrating these diagnostic modalities improves delayed cerebral ischemia prediction
