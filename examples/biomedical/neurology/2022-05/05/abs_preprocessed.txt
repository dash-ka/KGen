we sought to determine whether cognitive heterogeneity is mediated by variable amounts of concomitant nonalzheimer disease neuropathology
we sought to determine whether cognitive heterogeneity is mediated by different topographic distributions of tauaggregate neurofibrillary tangles
we sought to determine whether this agerelated clinical is mediated by different topographic distributions of tauaggregate neurofibrillary tangles

the relative distribution of neurofibrillary tangles density in hippocampus neocortex was calculated
microvascular copathologies were staged over 70 years
alphasynuclein tar dna binding protein 43 were staged in age at onset of 6170

alphasynuclein tar dna binding protein 43 were staged in age at onset of 5160 
the relative distribution of neurofibrillary tangles density in midfrontal neocortex was calculated

mediation examined relationships of pathologic findings with longitudinal cognitive decline
regression examined relationships of pathologic findings with longitudinal cognitive decline
regression examined relationships of pathologic findings with clinical features

patients with later age at onset of sporalzheimer diseaseic alzheimer disease were less likely to present with nonmemory complaints psychiatric symptoms
patients with later age at onset of sporalzheimer diseaseic alzheimer disease were functional impairment
tar dna binding protein 43 were more common in later onset alzheimer disease
microvascular copathology were more common in later onset alzheimer disease
alphasynuclein copathology was not related to age at onset
neurofibrillary tangles density in midfrontal neurofibrillary were lower in those with later age at onset
neurofibrillary tangles density in midfrontal cortex were lower in those with later age at onset
neurofibrillary tangles density in hippocampal neurofibrillary tangles ratio were lower in those with later age at onset
visuospatial cognitive deficits were less impaired in patients with later age at onset
executive function were less impaired in patients with later age at onset
mediation analyses showed that the effect of age at onset on severity of executive function deficits was mediated by concomitant nonalzheimer disease pathologies
mediation analyses showed that the effect of age at onset on severity of executive function deficits was mediated by midfrontal neurofibrillary neurofibrillary tangles ratio
mediation analyses showed that the effect of age at onset on severity of executive function deficits was mediated by midfrontal hippocampal neurofibrillary tangles ratio
hippocampal neurofibrillary tangles ratio also mediated an association between earlier age at onset on tests of global cognition

worse executive dysfunction is mediated by concomitant nonalzheimer disease neuropathology
worse executive dysfunction is mediated by greater relative midfrontal neocortical to hippocampal neurofibrillary tangles burden
