narcolepsy type 1 is an orphan brain disorder
an orphan brain disorder caused by the irreversible destruction of orexin neurons
onethird being obese
narcolepsy type 1 who have a body mass index 10 percent to 20 percent higher than the general population with onethird
metabolic disturbances are common in patients with narcolepsy type 1
besides the destruction of orexin neurons in narcolepsy type 1 the metabolic alterations in obese patients with narcolepsy type 1 remain unknown
besides the destruction of orexin neurons in narcolepsy type 1 the metabolic alterations in nonobese patients with narcolepsy type 1 remain unknown
the aim of this study was to identify possible differences in plasma metabolic profiles between patients with narcolepsy type 1
the aim of this study was to controls as a function of plasma metabolic profiles between patients with narcolepsy type 1 body mass index status
we used a targeted liquid chromatographymass spectrometry metabolomics approach to measure 141 lowmolecularweight metabolites in drugfree fasted plasma samples from 117 patients with narcolepsy type 1 compared with 116 body mass indexmatched controls
141 circulating
all showing increased concentrations in narcolepsy type 1
common metabolites were identified 12 phosphatidylcholine diacyls all
common metabolites were identified glutamate all
common metabolites were identified 5 longchain lysophosphatidylcholine acyls all
common metabolites driving the difference between controls regardless of body mass index
common metabolites were identified namely sarcosine all
common metabolites were identified nonaylcarnitine all
common metabolites driving the difference between patients with narcolepsy type 1
common metabolites were identified 1 sphingolipid all
common metabolites were identified 11 phosphatidylcholine acylakyls all
metabolite concentrations significantly affected by narcolepsy type 1 type 1 showed little overlap
metabolite concentrations significantly affected by narcolepsy type 1 type body mass index category showed little overlap
common metabolic pathways that were implicated in the narcolepsy type 1 type 1 control differences in both normal body mass index
quantitative enrichment analysis revealed common metabolic pathways namely glycine arachidonic acid and tryptophan metabolism
common metabolic pathways that were implicated in the narcolepsy type 1 type 1 control differences in both obese comparisons
