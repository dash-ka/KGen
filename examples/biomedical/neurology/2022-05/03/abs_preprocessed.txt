women have higher lifetime risk of stroke than men
metabolic factors seem more strongly associated with stroke for women than men
however few studies in either men or women have evaluated incident stroke
however few studies in either men or women have evaluated metabolomic profiles
we applied liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry to measure 519 plasma metabolites in a discovery set of women in the nurses health study with validation in 2 independent prospective cohorts nurses health study 2
we applied liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry to measure 519 plasma metabolites in a discovery set of women in the nurses health study with validation in 2 independent prospective cohorts prevencion con dieta mediterranea
we applied logistic regression models with stroke as the outcome to adjust for multiple risk factors
the false discovery rate was controlled through the q value method
twentythree metabolites were significantly associated with incident stroke in the nurses health study after adjustment for traditional risk factors
of twentythree metabolites these 4 metabolites were available in prevencion con dieta mediterranea
of twentythree metabolites these 4 metabolites were available in 3 were significantly associated with incident stroke n6acetyllysine
of twentythree metabolites these 4 metabolites were available in 3 were significantly associated with incident stroke methionine sulfoxide
of twentythree metabolites these 4 metabolites were available in 3 were significantly associated with incident stroke sucrose
in nurses health study 2 one of the 23 metabolites was significantly associated with incident stroke
for all 4 metabolites higher levels were associated with increased risk
these 4 metabolites were tested in prevencion con dieta mediterranea
these 4 metabolites were used to create a stroke metabolite score in the nurses health study
per unit of standard deviation of the odds ratio for incident stroke was 412 in prevencion con dieta mediterranea after adjustment for risk factors
per unit of standard deviation of stroke metabolite score ratio for incident stroke was 412 in prevencion con dieta mediterranea after adjustment for risk factors
stroke metabolite score
in prevencion con dieta mediterranea the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the model was 070 vs the area under the receiver operating characteristc curve for the model including traditional risk factors corresponding to a 5 percent improvement in risk prediction with stroke metabolite score

discussion metabolites included a carboxylic acid
discussion metabolites included 2 amino acids
discussion metabolites associated with stroke
discussion metabolites included sucrose
a composite stroke metabolite score was associated with ischemic stroke
discussion metabolites associated with stroke
showed improvement in risk prediction beyond traditional risk factors
a composite stroke metabolite score showed improvement in risk prediction beyond traditional risk factors
a composite stroke metabolite score

the nurses health study provides class ii evidence that a stroke metabolite score accurately predicts incident ischemic stroke risk
