patients with drugresistant epilepsy may improve quality of life
patients with drugresistant epilepsy may benefit from specialized testing and treatments to better control seizures
epilepsy centers accredited by the national association of epilepsy centers
procedures for drugresistant epilepsy in the united states are performed at epilepsy centers
most evaluations are performed at epilepsy centers
hospitalbased epilepsy monitoring other services
on an annual basis the national association of epilepsy centers collects data from accredited epilepsy centers on hospitalbased epilepsy
hospitalbased epilepsy monitoring unit size and admissions
hospitalbased epilepsy monitoring surgeries
hospitalbased epilepsy monitoring diagnostic testing
this article highlights trends in epilepsy center services from 2012 through 2019
data reported in 2016 from all level 3
level 4 accredited epilepsy centers
data reported in 2019 from all level 3
data reported in level 4
we analyzed data
data reported in 2012 from all level 3
data were analyzed by center population category
data were described using median for continuous variables
data were described using frequency for categorical variables
data were analyzed by center level
epilepsy monitoring unit admissions were also described using rates per population per year
aggregate procedure volumes were also described using rates per population per year
epileptologists were also described using rates per population per year
epilepsy monitoring unit beds were also described using rates per population per year
centers increased from 161 to 256 with the largest increases in adult centers
the period studied
centers increased from 161 to 256 with the largest increases in pediatric centers
during the period the number of national association of epilepsy centers accredited centers
epileptologists per population occurred
growth in epilepsy monitoring unit admissions epilepsy monitoring unit beds occurred
access to specialized testing and services broadly expanded
the largest growth in procedure volumes occurred in intracranial monitoring without resection over the study period
the largest growth in procedure volumes occurred in responsive neurostimulation implantations without resection over the study period
the largest growth in procedure volumes occurred in laser interstitial thermal therapy without resection over the study period
center growth leading to a decrease in median volumes of these procedures per center
vagus nerve stimulator implantations decreased while growth in hemispherectomies lagged center growth
vagus nerve stimulator implantations decreased while growth in extratemporal resections lagged center growth
vagus nerve stimulator implantations decreased while growth in temporal lobectomies lagged center growth
corpus callosotomies decreased while growth in extratemporal resections lagged center growth
corpus callosotomies decreased while growth in temporal lobectomies lagged center growth
corpus callosotomies decreased while growth in hemispherectomies lagged center growth
during the study period the availability of specialty epilepsy care in the united states improved as the national association of epilepsy centers implemented the national association of epilepsy centers accreditation program
surgical case complexity increased while aggregate surgical volume declined across most procedure types with a corresponding decline in cases per center
surgical case complexity increased while aggregate surgical volume remained stable
