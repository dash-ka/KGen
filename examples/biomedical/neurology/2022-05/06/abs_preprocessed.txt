the clinical course and outcome of the guillainbarre syndrome are diverse
the clinical course and outcome of the guillainbarre syndrome vary among regions
the modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome outcome score developed with data from dutch patients is a clinical model
a clinical model that predicts the risk of walking inability in patients with guillainbarre syndrome
the study objective was to improve the modified erasmus guillainbarre performance
the modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome outcome score in the the modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome outcome study cohort
the study objective was to validate the modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome
the study objective was to improve region specificity
we used prospective data from the first 1500 patients included in the modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome outcome study unable to walk independently
we used prospective data from the first 1500 patients included in the modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome outcome study aged over 6 years
for validation of modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome outcome score at entry 809 patients were eligible and 671 for validation of modified the modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome outcome score at week 1
operating characteristic curve values were over 07 in all regional subgroups
in north america subgroup observed outcomes were worse than predicted
in the europe observed outcomes were worse than predicted
in asia observed outcomes were better than predicted
recalibration enabled the development of a regionspecific version for north america
recalibration improved model accuracy
recalibration enabled the development of a regionspecific version for europe america
similar to the original modified erasmus syndrome outcome score were the predominant predictors of poor outcome in the the modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome outcome study cohort
similar to the original modified erasmus syndrome higher age were the predominant predictors of poor outcome in the the modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome outcome study cohort
similar to the original modified erasmus syndrome severe limb weakness were the predominant predictors of poor outcome in the the modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome outcome study cohort
modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome outcome score is a
a validated tool to predict the inability to walk unaided at 26 weeks in patients with guillainbarre syndrome also in countries outside the netherlands
a validated tool to predict the inability to walk unaided at 4 weeks in patients with guillainbarre syndrome also in countries outside the netherlands
we developed a regionspecific version of modified the modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome outcome score for patients from europe america
we developed a regionspecific version of modified the modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome outcome score for patients from north america
international guillainbarre syndrome outcome study provides class ii evidence that the modified the modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome outcome score accurately predicts the inability to walk unaided at 26 weeks in patients with the modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome
international guillainbarre syndrome outcome study provides class ii evidence that the modified the modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome outcome score accurately predicts the inability to walk unaided at 4 weeks in patients with the modified erasmus guillainbarre syndrome
