the utility of the total glasgow coma scale is limited due to reliance on language function evaluation
the full outline of unresponsiveness score was designed to circumvent this shortcoming instead adding evaluations of specific respiratory patterns
the full outline of unresponsiveness score was designed to circumvent this shortcoming instead adding evaluations of brainstem reflexes
we aimed to assess full outline of unresponsiveness score performance
we aimed to assess glasgow coma scale
we aimed to determine whether the verbal component of the glasgow coma scale among nonintubated patients with encephalopathy significantly contributes to mortality prediction
all prospectively consented the patients admitted to the internal medicine service at zambias university teaching hospital from october 3 2017 to may 21 2018 with a glasgow coma scale score below 10 have undergone simultaneous glasgow coma scale
all prospectively consented the patients admitted to the internal medicine service at zambias university teaching hospital from october 3 2017 to may 21 2018 with a glasgow coma scale score below 10 have undergone full outline of unresponsiveness score assessments
the patients were not eligible for mechanical ventilatory support per local standards
clinical characteristics were presented as either percentage frequencies
patients demographics were presented as numerical summaries of spread

the predictive power of the total glasgow coma scale without the verbal component vs full outline of unresponsiveness score on mortality was estimated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
the predictive power of the total glasgow coma scale without the verbal component vs total glasgow coma scale was estimated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
two hundred thirtyfive patients were enrolled
all patients were black
presumed etiology was cns infection metabolic encephalopathy
presumed etiology was cns infection systemic infection
presumed etiology was cns infection stroke
inhospital mortality was 83 percent
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for motor score vs total glasgow coma scale score did not differ
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for glasgow coma scale eye score vs total total full outline of unresponsiveness score did not differ
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for motor score vs total total full outline of unresponsiveness score did not differ
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for glasgow coma scale eye score vs total glasgow coma scale score did not differ
odds ratio mortality for glasgow coma scale score over 6 vs smaller was 032
odds ratio mortality for glasgow coma scale score over 6 vs equal to 6 was 032
for full outline of unresponsiveness score over 10 vs smaller it was 041
for full outline of unresponsiveness score over 10 vs equal to 10 it was 041
either glasgow coma scale is an acceptable scoring tool for mortality prediction in the resourcelimited setting
either full outline of unresponsiveness score is an acceptable scoring tool for mortality prediction in the resourcelimited setting
absence of a verbal component of glasgow coma scale had no significant impact on the performance of the total glasgow coma scale
these findings need further validation in the countries with readily available mechanical ventilatory support
these findings provides class i evidence that the verbal component of the total glasgow coma scale does not significantly contribute to a total glasgow coma scale score in mortality prediction among patients with encephalopathy
encephalopathy who are not intubated
