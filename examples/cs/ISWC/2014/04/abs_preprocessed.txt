only a small fraction of the information on the web is represented as linked data
this lack of coverage is partly due to the paradigms followed so far to extract linked data
extraction methods based on adhoc solutions
while converting structured data to rdf is well supported by tools most approaches to extract rdf from semistructured data rely on extraction methods
in this paper we present a opensource framework for the extraction of rdf from templated websites
in this paper we present a holistic framework for the extraction of rdf from templated websites
we discuss the architecture of the initial implementation of each of a holistic framework for the extraction of rdf components
we discuss the architecture of a opensource framework for the extraction of rdf
we discuss the architecture of a holistic framework for the extraction of rdf
we discuss the architecture of the initial implementation of each of a opensource framework for the extraction of rdf components
in particular we present a novel wrapper induction technique
a novel wrapper induction technique that does not require any human supervision to detect the wrappers
a consistency layer with which the data can be checked for logical consistency
a holistic framework for the extraction of rdf also includes a consistency layer
the data extracted by the wrappers
a opensource framework for the extraction of rdf also includes a consistency layer
we evaluate the initial version of rex on three different datasets
we results clearly show the potential of using templated web pages to extend the linked data cloud
moreover our results indicate the weaknesses of we how our current implementations can be extended
