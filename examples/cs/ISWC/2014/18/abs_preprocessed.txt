semantic data publishing which converts the web from a web of document to a web of interlinked knowledge
linking open data is the largest community effort for semantic data publishing
while the state of the open data contains billion of triples the state of the art open data has only a limited number of schema information
while the state of the open data contains billion of triples the state of the art open data is lack of schemalevel axioms
triples describing millions of entities
to close the gap between the open data we contribute to the complementary part of the open data that is linking open schema
to close the gap between the expressive ontologies we contribute to the complementary part of the open data that is linking open schema
in this paper we introduce the first effort to publish chinese linked open schema
in this paper we introduce zhishischema 
we collect navigational categories from more than 50 various most popular social web sites in china
we collect dynamic tags from more than 50 various most popular social web sites in china
we then propose a twostage method to capture equivalence subsumption
the collected categories and tags which results in a large semantic network
the collected categories and tags which results in an integrated concept taxonomy
we then relate relationships between the collected categories and tags
experimental results show the high quality of zhishischema
compared with category systems of babelnet zhishischema contains the largest number of subsumptions between categories
compared with category systems of freebase zhishischema contains the largest number of subsumptions between categories
compared with category systems of babelnet zhishischema has wide coverage of categories
compared with category systems of yago zhishischema has wide coverage of categories
compared with category systems of dbpedia zhishischema contains the largest number of subsumptions between categories
compared with category systems of freebase zhishischema has wide coverage of categories
compared with category systems of dbpedia zhishischema has wide coverage of categories
compared with category systems of yago zhishischema contains the largest number of subsumptions between categories
when substituting zhishischema for the original category system of zhishime we not only filter out incorrect category subsumptions but also add more finergrained categories
