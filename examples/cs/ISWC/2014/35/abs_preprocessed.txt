in this paper we study query answering
in this paper we study rewriting in ontologybased data access
ontologies expressed in the description logic elhio
specifically we present an algorithm for computing a perfect rewriting of unions of conjunctive queries posed over ontologies 2 el profiles
the description logic elhio which covers the owl 2 ql and owl
the novelty of our algorithm is the use of a set of abox dependencies
abox dependencies which are compiled into a socalled ebox to limit the expansion of the rewriting
so far eboxes have only been used in query rewriting in the case of dllite
dllite which is less expressive than elhio
in this paper we discuss the tradeoff between the reduction of the size of the rewriting and the computational cost of we approach
we have extensively evaluated we new query rewriting technique
