In this paper we present Semano 
In this paper we present a generic framework for annotating natural language texts with entities of OWL 2 DL ontologies
Semano generalizes the mechanism of JAPE transducers
JAPE transducers that has been introduced within the General Architecture for Text Engineering to enable modular development of annotation rule bases
a generic framework for annotating natural language texts with entities of OWL 2 DL ontologies generalizes the mechanism of JAPE transducers
rule templates called The core of the Semano rule base model instantiations
The core of the Semano rule base model are rule templates
rule templates called japelates
While Semano is generic a generic framework for annotating natural language texts with entities of OWL 2 DL ontologies provides several generic japelates
While Semano does not make assumptions about the document characteristics Semano provides several generic japelates
While a generic framework for annotating natural language texts with entities of OWL 2 DL ontologies does not make assumptions about the document characteristics a generic framework for annotating natural language texts with entities of OWL 2 DL ontologies provides several generic japelates
several generic japelates that can serve as a starting point
While a generic framework for annotating natural language texts with entities of OWL 2 DL ontologies does not make assumptions about the document characteristics Semano provides several generic japelates
the document characteristics used within japelates
While a generic framework for annotating natural language texts with entities of OWL 2 DL ontologies is generic Semano provides several generic japelates

Also Semano provides a tool
Also a generic framework for annotating natural language texts with entities of OWL 2 DL ontologies provides a tool
a tool that can generate an initial rule base from an ontology
an initial rule base can be easily extended to meet the requirements of the application in question
In addition to an initial rule base Java API a generic framework for annotating natural language texts with entities of OWL 2 DL ontologies includes two GUI components an annotation viewer
In addition to an initial rule base Java API Semano includes two GUI components an annotation viewer
In addition to an initial rule base Java API Semano includes two GUI components a rule base editor
In addition to an initial rule base Java API a generic framework for annotating natural language texts with entities of OWL 2 DL ontologies includes two GUI components a rule base editor
In combination with the rule generator two GUI components an annotation viewer can be used by domain experts
In combination with the default japelates two GUI components an annotation viewer can be used by domain experts
In combination with the rule generator two GUI components a rule base editor can be used by domain experts
domain experts that are not familiar with the technical details of the framework to set up a domainspecific annotator
In combination with the default japelates two GUI components a rule base editor can be used by domain experts
In this paper we introduce the rule base model of Semano a generic framework for annotating natural language texts with entities of OWL 2 DL ontologies provide examples of adapting an initial rule base to meet particular application requirements and report we experience with applying a generic framework for annotating natural language texts with entities of OWL 2 DL ontologies within the domain of nano technology
