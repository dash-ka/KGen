this paper describes tableminer
this paper describes bootstrapping learning approach selected  partial  data from a table
this paper describes the first semantic table interpretation method
the first semantic table interpretation method that adopts an incremental mutually recursive
bootstrapping learning approach seeded by automatically
columns containing named entity
tableminer labels columns mentions with semantic concepts that best describe data in these columns
tableminer labels columns mentions with semantic concepts that best disambiguates entity content cells in these columns
tableminer is able to use various types of contextual information outside tables for table interpretation including eg rdfamicrodata annotations  that to the best of our knowledge have never been used in natural language processing tasks

evaluation on two datasets shows that compared to two baselines tableminer consistently obtains the best performance
in the classification task tableminer achieves significant improvements of between 008 f1 depending on different baseline methods in the classification task tableminer outperforms both baselines by between 019 in precision on one dataset and between 003 f1 on the other dataset
in the classification task tableminer achieves significant improvements of 038 f1 depending on different baseline methods in the classification task tableminer outperforms both baselines by between 037 in precision on one dataset and between 002 f1 on the other dataset
