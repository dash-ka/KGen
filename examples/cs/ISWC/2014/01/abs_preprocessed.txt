Links between knowledge bases build the backbone of the Linked Data Web
In previous works the combination of the results of timeefficient algorithms through settheoretical operators has been shown to be very timeefficient for Link Discovery
However the further optimization of such link specifications has not been paid much attention to
further optimizing the runtime of link specifications by presenting Helios
We address the issue of further a runtime optimizer for Link Discovery
Helios comprises both a rewriter for link specifications
Helios comprises both an execution planner for link specifications
a rewriter is a sequence of fixedpoint iterators for algebraic rules
The planner relies on timeefficient evaluation functions to generate execution plans for link specifications
17 specifications created by human experts
We evaluate Helios on 17 specifications generated automatically
17 specifications created by 2180 specifications
We evaluation shows that Helios is up to 300 times faster than a canonical planner
Moreover Helios improvements are statistically significant
