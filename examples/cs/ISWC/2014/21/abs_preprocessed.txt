Matrix Factorisation is a recommendation approach
A central limitation of this approach however is that this approach can not capture how a users tastes have evolved beforehand thereby ignoring if a users preference for a factor is likely to change
One solution to this is to include users preferences for semantic  categories however this approach is limited should a user be presented with an item so called coldstart categories
an item for which Matrix Factorisation has not rated the semantic categories previously
One solution to this is to include users preferences for ie  categories however this approach is limited should a user be presented with an item so called coldstart categories
ie linked data
In this paper we present a method to overcome this limitation by transferring rated semantic categories in place of unrated categories through the use of vertex kernels
In this paper we present a method to overcome this limitation by transferring incorporate this into our prior SemanticSVD model
our evaluated several vertex kernels
empirically demonstrate the superior performance that our achieve over existing SVD models
empirically demonstrate the superior performance that our achieve over existing SemanticSVD with no transferred semantic categories
our several vertex kernels effects on recommendation error
