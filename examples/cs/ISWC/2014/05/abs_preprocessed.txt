in this paper we show how event processing over semantically annotated streams of events can be exploited for implementing tracking of products in supply chains through the automated generation of linked pedigrees
in this paper we show how event processing over semantically annotated streams of events can be exploited for implementing tracing of products in supply chains through the automated generation of linked pedigrees
in our abstraction events are encoded as spatially and temporally oriented named graphs while linked pedigrees as rdf datasets are linked pedigrees as rdf datasets specific compositions
an algorithm that operates over streams of rdf annotated epcis events to generate linked pedigrees
our propose an algorithm
our exemplify our approach using the pharmaceuticals supply chain
our show how counterfeit detection is an implicit part of our pedigree generation
our evaluation results show that for fast moving supply chains smaller window sizes on event streams provide significantly higher efficiency in the generation of pedigrees
our evaluation results show that for fast moving supply chains smaller window sizes on event streams enable early counterfeit detection
