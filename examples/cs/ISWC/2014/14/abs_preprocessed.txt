We present the Dutch Ships
We present Sailors Linked Data Cloud
This heterogeneous dataset brings together four curated datasets on Dutch Maritime history as fivestar linked data
separate datamodels designed in close collaboration with maritime historical researchers
The individual datasets use separate datamodels
The individual models are mapped to a common interoperability layer allowing for analysis of the data on the general level
We present the datasets to external data sources
We present links to external data sources
We present modeling decisions to external data sources
We present internal links to external data sources
We show ways of accessing the data
We show ways of present a number of examples of how This heterogeneous dataset can be used for historical research
