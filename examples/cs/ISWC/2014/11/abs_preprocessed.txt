as the web of data is growing at an ever increasing speed the lack of reliable query solutions for live public data becomes apparent
sparql implementations have deliver impressive performance for public sparql endpoints yet poor availability especially under high loads prevents sparql implementations use in realworld applications
sparql implementations have matured yet poor availability especially under high loads prevents sparql implementations use in realworld applications
linked data fragments that enable lowcost publication of queryable data by moving intelligence from the server to the client
we propose to tackle this availability problem by defining a specific kind of linked data fragments
we propose to tackle this availability problem by defining triple pattern fragments
this paper formalizes the linked data fragments concept
this paper verifies servers availability under load
a clientside sparql query processing algorithm that uses a dynamic iterator pipeline
this paper introduces a clientside sparql query processing algorithm
the results indicate that at the cost of lower performance query techniques with triple pattern fragments lead to high availability thereby allowing for reliable applications on top of public queryable linked data
