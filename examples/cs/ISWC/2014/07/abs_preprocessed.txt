the increase in the volume and heterogeneity of biomedical data sources enhance information discovery
the increase in the volume and heterogeneity of biomedical data sources has motivated researchers to embrace linked data technologies to solve the ensuing integration challenges
as an integral part of the eu granatum project a linked biomedical dataspace augment the design of in silico experiments for cancer chemoprevention drug discovery
as an integral part of the eu granatum project a linked biomedical dataspace was developed to semantically interlink data from multiple sources
the different components of the a linked biomedical dataspace facilitate both the biomedical researchers to publish link query
the different components of the a linked biomedical dataspace visually explore the heterogeneous datasets
the different components of the a linked biomedical dataspace facilitate both the bioinformaticians to publish link query
we have extensively evaluated the usability of the entire platform
in this paper we showcase three different workflows
three different workflows depicting realworld scenarios on the use of a linked biomedical dataspace by the domain users to intuitively retrieve meaningful information from the integrated sources
the collaborative processes which would make it easier for linked data practitioners to create such dataspaces in other domains
we report the important lessons that we learned through the challenges encountered
we accumulated experience during the collaborative processes
we also provide a concise set of generic recommendations to develop linked data platforms useful for drug discovery
