a considerable portion of the information on the semantic web is still only available in unstructured form
implementing the vision of the semantic web thus requires transforming this unstructured data into structured data
one key step during this process is the recognition of named entities
previous works suggest that ensemble learning can be used to improve the performance of named entity recognition tools
however no comparison of the performance of existing supervised machine has been presented so far
existing supervised machine learning approaches on this task
we address this research gap by presenting a thorough evaluation of named entity recognition based on ensemble learning
to this end we combine four different stateofthe approaches by using 15 different algorithms for ensemble learning
to this end we evaluate ensemble learning performace on five different datasets
we results suggest that ensemble learning can reduce the error rate of stateoftheart named entity recognition systems by 40
