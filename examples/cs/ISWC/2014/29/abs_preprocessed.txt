Many tasks in which a system needs to mediate between natural language expressions and elements of a vocabulary in an ontology or dataset
Many tasks require knowledge about how the elements of ie individuals  are expressed in natural language
Many tasks require knowledge about how the elements of the vocabulary  are expressed in natural language
Many tasks require knowledge about how the elements of ie classes  are expressed in natural language
Many tasks require knowledge about how the elements of ie properties  are expressed in natural language
In a multilingual setting such knowledge is needed for each of the supported languages
In this paper we present a framework for automatically inducing ontology lexica in multiple languages on the basis of a multilingual corpus
In this paper we present MATOLL 
languagespecific dependency patterns which are run over a parsed corpus
languagespecific dependency patterns which are formalized as SPARQL queries
a framework for automatically inducing ontology lexica in multiple languages on the basis of a multilingual corpus exploits a set of languagespecific dependency patterns
We have instantiated the system for two languages English
We have instantiated the system for two languages German
We evaluate the system for two languages English in terms of recall for German by comparing an automatically induced lexicon to manually constructed ontology lexica for DBpedia
We evaluate the system for two languages English in terms of precision for English by comparing an automatically induced lexicon to manually constructed ontology lexica for DBpedia

In particular We perform an analysis of the impact of different parameters
In particular We investigate the contribution of each single dependency pattern
