SPARQL 11 supports the use of ontologies to enrich query results with logical entailments
OWL 2 provides a dedicated fragment OWL QL for this purpose
Typical implementations use the OWL QL schema to rewrite a conjunctive query into an equivalent set of queries to be answered against the nonschema part of the data
With the adoption of the recent SPARQL 11 standard
however RDF databases are capable of answering much more expressive queries directly
we ask how this can be exploited in query rewriting
We find that SPARQL 11 is powerful enough to  implement  a fullfledged OWL QL reasoner in a single query
Using additional SPARQL 11 features we develop a new method of schemaagnostic query rewriting where arbitrary conjunctive queries over OWL QL are rewritten into equivalent SPARQL 11 queries in a way
a way that is fully independent of the actual schema
This allows us to query RDF data under OWL QL entailment without extracting OWL axioms
This allows us to query RDF data under OWL QL entailment without preprocessing OWL axioms
