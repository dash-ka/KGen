semantic datasets provide support to automate many tasks such as decisionmaking answering
however semantic datasets performance is always decreased by the noises in the datasets among which noisy type assertions play an important role
this problem has been mainly studied in the domain of data mining
this problem has been mainly studied in the semantic web community
in this paper we study the problem of noisy type assertion detection in semantic web datasets by making use of concept disjointness relationships
concept disjointness relationships hidden in the datasets
we transform noisy type assertion detection into multiclass classification of pairs of type assertions
type assertions which type an individual to two potential disjoint concepts
the multiclass classification is solved by adaboost with c4 5 as the base classifier
furthermore we propose instanceconcept compatability metrics based on instanceinstance relationships
furthermore we propose instanceconcept compatability metrics based on instanceconcept assertions
we evaluate the approach on both synthetic datasets and dbpedia
we approach effectively detect noisy type assertions in dbpedia with a high precision of 95
