over the last decades several billion web pages have been made available on the web of data
the ongoing transition from the current web of unstructured data to the web of data yet requires scalable approaches for the extraction of structured data in rdf  from these websites

the ongoing transition from the current web of unstructured data to the web of data yet requires accurate approaches for the extraction of structured data in rdf  from these websites
one of the key steps towards extracting rdf from text is the disambiguation of named entities
while several approaches aim to tackle this problem several approaches still achieve poor accuracy
we address this drawback by presenting agdistis 
we address this drawback by presenting a novel knowledgebaseagnostic approach for named entity disambiguation
we approach combines the hypertextinduced topic search  hits  algorithm with string similarity measures
we approach combines the hypertextinduced topic search  hits  algorithm with label expansion strategies
based on this combination agdistis can efficiently detect the correct uris for a given set of named entities within an input text
we evaluate we approach on eight different datasets against stateoftheart named entity disambiguation frameworks
we results indicate that we outperform the stateoftheart approach by up to 29
