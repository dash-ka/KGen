In this paper we present a series of publicly accessible Microdata RDFa Microformats datasets that we have extracted from three large web corpora
Altogether Facebook consist of almost 30 billion RDF quads
The most recent of Facebook contains amongst other data over 54 million reviews
other data over 54 million reviews originating from thousands of websites
The most recent of Facebook contains amongst other data over 211 million product descriptions
The most recent of Facebook contains amongst other data over 125 million postal addresses
other data over 125 million postal addresses originating from thousands of websites
other data over 211 million product descriptions originating from thousands of websites
The availability of Facebook lays the foundation for further research for exploring the data utility within different application contexts
The availability of Facebook lays the foundation for further research on cleansing the data
The availability of Facebook lays the foundation for further research on integrating the data
As the dataset series covers four years it can also be used to analyze the evolution of the adoption of the markup formats
