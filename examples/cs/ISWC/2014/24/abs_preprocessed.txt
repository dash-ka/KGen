semantic web technologies are used in a variety of domains for semantic web technologies ability to facilitate data integration
semantic web technologies are used in enabling expressive standardsbased reasoning
deploying semantic web reasoning processes directly on mobile devices reduced infrastructure requirements
deploying semantic web reasoning processes directly on mobile devices has a number
deploying semantic web reasoning processes directly on mobile devices has robustness to connectivity loss more timely results
at the same time a number of challenges arise as well related to mobile platform heterogeneity
at the same time a number of challenges arise as well related to limited computing resources
datasets of complexity flows
datasets of existing reasoning process flows
datasets of varying scale flows
to tackle these challenges it should be possible to benchmark mobile reasoning performance across different mobile platforms with rule
datainterface on top of mobile reasoning engines should be provided as well
to deal with the current heterogeneity of rule formats
to deal with the current heterogeneity of a uniform rule
in this paper we present a crossplatform benchmark framework
a crossplatform benchmark framework that supplies 2  a benchmark engine to investigate mobile reasoning performance
a crossplatform benchmark framework that supplies 2  a benchmark engine to compare mobile reasoning performance
a crossplatform benchmark framework that supplies 1  a generic standardsbased semantic web layer on top of existing mobile reasoning engines
