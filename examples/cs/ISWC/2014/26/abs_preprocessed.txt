while the semantic web currently can exhibit provenance information by using the w3c prov standards there is a  missing link  in connecting prov to storing for dynamic changes to rdf graphs
rdf graphs using sparql
while the semantic web currently can exhibit provenance information by using the w3c prov standards there is a  missing link  in connecting prov to querying for dynamic changes to rdf graphs
solving this problem would be required for such clear usecases as the creation of version control systems for rdf

in this paper we explore how the provenance information can be defined by reinterpreting sparql updates
in this paper we explore how to represent the resulting provenance records sparql updates as rdf in a manner compatible with w3c prov
rdf datasets that change over time in response to sparql updates
in this paper we explore how to adapt the dynamic copypaste provenance model of buneman et al to rdf datasets
the primary contribution of this paper we explore how to adapt the dynamic copypaste provenance model of buneman is a semantic framework
a semantic framework that enables the semantics of sparql update to be used as the basis for a  cutandpaste  provenance model in a principled manner
