the ability to integrate a wealth of humancurated knowledge from scientific datasets and ontologies can benefit drugtarget interaction prediction
the hypothesis is that similar drugs interact with the same targets
similar targets interact with the same drugs
the our use semantic knowledge between drugs reflect a chemical semantic space while our use semantic knowledge between targets reflect a genomic semantic space
in this paper we present drugdrug similarity edges
a heterogeneous graph that includes drugtarget interaction edges
a novel method that combines semantic knowledge  from ontologies
in this paper we present a novel method the edges of a heterogeneous graph
a novel method that combines semantic knowledge  from semantic spaces
a novel method that combines our use semantic knowledge  from semantic spaces
a novel method that combines an algorithmic approach to partition
in this paper we present targettarget similarity edges
a novel method that combines a data mining framework for link prediction
a novel method that combines our use semantic knowledge  from ontologies
community detection which allows a node to participate in more than one cluster or community
edge based community detection
our semantics based edge partitioning approach semep
our semantics has the advantages of edge
the semep problem is to create a minimal partitioning of the edges such that the cluster density of each subset of edges is maximal
our use semantic knowledge to specify specific drugtarget interaction edges that should not participate in the same cluster
our use semantic knowledge to specify edge constraints that should not participate in the same cluster
stateoftheart machine learning based prediction methods
using a wellknown dataset of drugtarget interactions we demonstrate the benefits of using semep predictions to improve the performance of a range of stateoftheart machine learning
validation of the novel best reflect both accurate and diverse predictions
the novel best predicted interactions of semep against the stitch interaction resource
