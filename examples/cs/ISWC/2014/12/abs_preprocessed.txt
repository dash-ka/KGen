sparql is the query language for the resource description framework
the resource description framework is a standard for conceptually describing data on the web
as the resource description framework data continue to be integrated at webscale such as in the linked open data cloud the resource description framework data management systems are being exposed to queries
as the resource description framework data continue to be published across heterogeneous domains management systems are being exposed to workloads
workloads that are far more varied

queries that are far more diverse
an indepth experimental analysis that shows existing sparql benchmarks are not suitable for testing systems for diverse queries
the first contribution of our work is an indepth experimental analysis
an indepth experimental analysis that varied workloads
the waterloo sparql diversity test suite that provides stress testing tools for the resource description framework data management systems
to address these shortcomings our second contribution is the waterloo sparql diversity test suite
evaluations using earlier benchmarks
using the waterloo sparql diversity test suite our have been able to reveal issues with existing systems
existing systems that went unnoticed in evaluations
specifically our experiments with five popular the resource description framework data management systems show that management systems can not deliver good performance uniformly across workloads
for some queries there can be as much as five orders of magnitude difference between the query execution time of the fastest while the fastest system on one query may unexpectedly time out on another query

by performing a detailed analysis we pinpoint these problems to specific types of workloads
