Unfortunately this wealth of data remains inaccessible to those without indepth knowledge of semantic technologies
We visually analyse Linked Data
We describe a toolchain enabling users without semantic technology background to explore
scenarios involving data from the Linked Open Data Cloud
research data extracted from scientific publications
We demonstrate Linked Data applicability in scenarios
the Webbased frontend consisting of visualisation tools
the Webbased frontend consisting of querying tools
We focus is on the Webbased frontend
mainly positive results confirming that the Query Wizard simplifies searching transforming  in particular that people learn to perform interactive analysis tasks on the resulting Linked Data
people using the Query Wizard quickly
