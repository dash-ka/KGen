googles introduce a new methodology for benchmarking the performance per watt of semantic web reasoners with information critical for deploying semantic web tools on powerconstrained devices
googles rule engines on smartphones to provide developers with information critical for deploying semantic web tools on powerconstrained devices
googles validate googles methodology by applying our methodology to rule engines answering queries on two ontologies with expressivities in rdfs dl
googles validate googles methodology by applying our methodology to three wellknown reasoners answering queries on two ontologies with expressivities in rdfs dl

while this validation was conducted on smartphones googles methodology may be applied to reasoners to determine performance relevant to power consumption
while this validation was conducted on smartphones googles methodology may be applied to ontologies to determine performance relevant to power consumption
while this validation was conducted on smartphones googles methodology may be applied to entire applications to determine performance relevant to power consumption
while this validation was conducted on smartphones googles methodology is general
smartphones running googles android operating system
while this validation was conducted on smartphones googles methodology may be applied to different hardware platforms to determine performance relevant to power consumption
we discuss the implications of we findings for sensor networks
we discuss the implications of we findings for the internet of things
we discuss the implications of we findings for other powerconstrained environments
we discuss the implications of we findings for balancing tradeoffs of local computation versus communication costs for semantic technologies on mobile platforms
