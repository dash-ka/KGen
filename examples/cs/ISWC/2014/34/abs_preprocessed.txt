data instances stored in relational databases
We present an extension of the ontologybased data access platform Ontop
the ontologybased data access platform Ontop that supports answering SPARQL queries under the OWL 2 QL direct semantics entailment regime for data instances
On the theoretical side we show how any input SPARQL query OWL 2 QL ontology can be rewritten to an equivalent SQL query solely over the data
On the theoretical side we show how R2RML mappings can be rewritten to an equivalent SQL query solely over the data
Tmappings compiling R2RML mappings with ontology hierarchies
Tmapping optimisations using database integrity constraints
initial experimental results demonstrating that by applying the the ontologybased data access platform Ontop technologies the treewitness query Tmappings  the system produces scalable SQL queries
