data instances stored in relational databases
we present an extension of the ontologybased data access platform ontop
the ontologybased data access platform ontop that supports answering sparql queries under the owl 2 ql direct semantics entailment regime for data instances
on the theoretical side we show how r2rml mappings can be rewritten to an equivalent sql query solely over the data
on the theoretical side we show how any input sparql query owl 2 ql ontology can be rewritten to an equivalent sql query solely over the data
initial experimental results demonstrating that by applying the ontop technologies the treewitness query  the system produces scalable sql queries
tmappings compiling r2rml mappings with ontology hierarchies
initial experimental results demonstrating that by applying the ontop technologies tmapping optimisations  the system produces scalable sql queries
on the theoretical side we present initial experimental results
tmapping optimisations using database integrity constraints
the treewitness query rewriting
initial experimental results demonstrating that by applying the ontop technologies tmappings  the system produces scalable sql queries
tmapping optimisations using sql expressivity
