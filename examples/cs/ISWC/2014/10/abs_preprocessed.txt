driven by initiatives like schemaorg the amount of semantically annotated data is expected to grow steadily towards massive scale requiring clusterbased solutions to query clusterbased solutions
at the same time hadoop has become dominant in the area of big data processing with large infrastructures
large infrastructures being already used in manifold application fields
large infrastructures being already deployed in manifold application fields
for hadoopbased applications a common data pool provides many synergy benefits
many synergy benefits making hadoopbased very attractive to use these infrastructures for semantic data processing as well
indeed existing sparqlon hadoop approaches have already demonstrated very good scalability however query runtimes are rather slow due to the underlying batch processing framework
while this is acceptable for dataintensive queries it is not satisfactory for the majority of sparql queries
sparql queries that are typically much more selective requiring only small subsets of the data
in this paper we present sempala
a sparqloversqlonhadoop approach designed with selective queries in mind
in this paper we present a sparqloversqlonhadoop approach
our evaluation shows performance improvements by an order of magnitude compared to existing approaches paving the way for interactivetime sparql query processing on hadoop
