exploiting identity links among rdf resources allows applications to efficiently integrate data
keys can be very useful to discover these identity links
a key when a set of properties values uniquely identify resources
a set of properties is considered as a key
however keys are usually not available
the approaches can easily require clean data
the approaches that attempt to automatically discover keys
the approaches can easily be overwhelmed by the size of the data
we present an approach
an approach that discovers keys in rdf data in an efficient way
we present sakey
to prune the search space sakey exploits characteristics of the data
the data that are dynamically detected during the process
datasets where erroneous data or duplicates exist
furthermore we approach can discover keys in datasets  ie almost keys 
our approach has been evaluated on different synthetic
our approach has been evaluated on real datasets
the results show both the relevance of almost keys
the results show both the relevance of the efficiency of discovering almost keys
