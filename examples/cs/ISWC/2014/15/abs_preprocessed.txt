The central idea of Linked Data is that data publishers support applications in integrating data by complying to a set of best practices in metadata provision
In 2011 the State of the LOD Cloud report analyzed the adoption of these best practices by linked datasets within different topical domains
the LOD Cloud report was based on information
information that was provided by the dataset publishers the dataset publishers themselves via the datahubio Linked Data catalog via the datahubio Linked Data catalog
In this paper we update the findings of the 2011 State of the LOD Cloud report based on a crawl of the Web of Linked Data
In this paper we revisit the findings of the 2011 State of the LOD Cloud report based on a crawl of the Web of Linked Data
Linked Data conducted in April 2014
We analyze how the adoption of the different best practices has changed and present an overview of the linkage relationships between datasets in the form of an updated LOD cloud diagram this time not based on information from dataset providers but on data
data that can actually be retrieved by a Linked Data crawler
Among others we find that there is increased agreement on common vocabularies for describing certain types of entities
Among others we find that provenance metadata is still rarely provided by the data sources
Among others we find that license metadata is still rarely provided by the data sources
Among others we find that the number of linked datasets has approximately doubled between 2011
