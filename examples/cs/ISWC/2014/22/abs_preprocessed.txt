outlier detection used for identifying wrong values in data
outlier detection is typically applied to single datasets to search data for values of unexpected behavior
an approach which combines the outcomes of two independent outlier detection runs to get a more reliable result
problems arising from natural outliers
natural outliers which are nevertheless correct
in this work we instead propose an approach
natural outliers which are exceptional values in the dataset
an approach which combines the outcomes of two independent outlier detection runs to also prevent problems
linked data is especially suited for the application of such an idea since linked data also contains explicit links between instances
linked data is especially suited for the application of such an idea since linked data provides large amounts of data
data enriched with hierarchical information
the property values extracted from a single repository
in a first step we apply outlier detection methods to the property values using a novel approach for splitting the data into relevant subsets
for the second step we exploit owl sameas links for the instances to perform a second outlier detection on additional property values
for the second step we exploit owl sameas links for the instances to get additional property values
doing so allows us to reject the assessment of a wrong value
doing so allows us to confirm the assessment of a wrong value
experiments on the nell datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our approach
experiments on the dbpedia datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our approach
