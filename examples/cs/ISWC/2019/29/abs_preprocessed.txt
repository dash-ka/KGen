Relation linking
Relation is an important problem for knowledge graphbased Question Answering
Given a knowledge graph the task is to identify relevant relations from the given knowledge graph
Given a natural language question the task is to identify relevant relations from the given knowledge graph
entities extracted from the question to support relation

relation linking
Since existing techniques for entity extraction are more stable compared to relation our idea is to exploit entities
Since linking are more stable compared to relation our idea is to exploit entities
In this paper we propose a novel approach based on DBpedia entities for computing relation candidates
We have empirically evaluated We approach on different standard benchmarks
We evaluation shows that We approach significantly outperforms existing baseline systems in both recall precision and runtime
