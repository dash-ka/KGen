knowledge graphs are used in an increasing number of applications
although considerable human effort has been invested into making knowledge graphs available in multiple languages most knowledge graphs are in english
additionally regional facts are often only available in the language of the corresponding region
this lack of multilingual knowledge availability clearly limits the porting of machine learning models to different languages
in this paper we aim to alleviate this drawback by proposing thoth 
in this paper we aim to alleviate this drawback by proposing an approach for translating knowledge graphs
in this paper we aim to alleviate this drawback by proposing an approach for enriching knowledge graphs
thoth extracts bilingual alignments between target knowledge graph
thoth extracts bilingual alignments between a source
thoth extracts learns how to translate from one to the other by relying on two different recurrent neural network models along with knowledge graph embeddings
we evaluated thoth extrinsically by comparing the german dbpedia with the german translation of the english dbpedia on two tasks fact checking and entity
fact checking and entity linking
in addition we ran a manual intrinsic evaluation of the german translation of the english dbpedia
a promising approach which achieves a translation accuracy of 8856 percent
we results show that thoth is a promising approach
moreover we enrichment improves the quality of the german dbpedia significantly as we report  1  for entity
entity linking
moreover we enrichment improves the quality of the german dbpedia significantly as we report 19 percent f  for entity
moreover we enrichment improves the quality of the german dbpedia significantly as we report 184 percent accuracy for fact validation
