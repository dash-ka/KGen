the ontologybased data access  paradigm can ease access to incomplete data sources in many application domains

obda  paradigm can ease access to heterogeneous data sources in many application domains
however stateoftheart tools are still based on the dllite family of description logics
owl 2 ql which despite its usefulness is not sufficiently expressive for many domains
description logics that underlies owl 2 ql
the consensus is that horn description logics like horn  mathcal shiq  are particularly promising
accommodating more expressive ontology languages remains an open challenge
many ontologies can not be handled
a prerequisite for obda is supported in existing reasoners
query answering in horn   is supported in existing reasoners
mathcal shiq   is supported in existing reasoners
this is largely because algorithms build on an aboxindependent approach to ontological reasoning
ontological reasoning that easily incurs in an exponential behaviour
as an alternative to full aboxindependence in this paper we advocate taking into account general information about the structure of the aboxes of interest
this have a predictable structure
this is especially natural in the setting of obda where aboxes are generated via mappings
the abox which can be obtained from the mappings of an obda specification
guides ontological reasoning using the possible combinations of concepts
concepts that may occur in the abox
we present a simple yet effective approach that guides ontological reasoning
