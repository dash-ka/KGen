adjectives most of which play the role of factoid constraints on the modified nouns
While mapping relational phrases to semantic constructs in The rapid progress of question answering LRB QA RRB systems over knowledge bases has been extensively studied little attention has been devoted to adjectives
While mapping proper nouns to semantic constructs in The rapid progress of question answering LRB QA RRB systems over knowledge bases has been extensively studied little attention has been devoted to adjectives
In this paper we study the problem of finding appropriate representations for adjectives over The rapid progress of question answering LRB QA RRB systems over knowledge bases
We propose a novel approach to automatically map an adjective to several existential restrictions negation forms
a novel approach called Adj2ER
We propose a novel approach to automatically map an adjective to several existential restrictions negation forms
Specifically we leverage statistic measures for generating supervised learning for filtering the candidates
the candidates which largely overcome the lexical gap
the candidates which largely reduce the search space
Specifically we leverage statistic measures for generating candidate existential restrictions for filtering the candidates
We create two question sets with adjectives from Yahoo Answers
We create two question sets with conduct experiments over DBpedia
We create two question sets with adjectives from QALD
We experimental results show that Adj2ER can generate highquality mappings for most adjectives
We experimental results show that Adj2ER can generate highquality mappings for significantly outperform several alternative approaches
Furthermore current QA systems can gain a promising improvement when integrating our adjective mapping approach
