Nongoal oriented generative dialogue systems lack the ability to generate answers with grounded facts
the real world consisting of wellgrounded facts
A knowledge graph can be considered an abstraction of the real world
This paper addresses the problem of generating wellgrounded responses by integrating knowledge graphs into the dialogue systems response generation process in an endtoend manner
A dataset for nongoal oriented dialogues is proposed in This paper in the domain of soccer conversing on different clubs along with a knowledge graph for each of national teams

A dataset for nongoal oriented dialogues is proposed in This paper in the domain of soccer conversing on different clubs along with a knowledge graph for each of different clubs
this dataset which can integrate knowledge graphs into the response generation process producing well articulated
A novel neural network architecture is also proposed as a baseline on this dataset knowledge grounded responses
knowledge graph integrated dialogue systems
Empirical evidence suggests that the proposed model performs better than other stateoftheart models for knowledge graph
