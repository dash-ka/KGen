reusing existing datasets is of considerable significance to developers
reusing existing datasets is of considerable significance to researchers
dataset search engines help a user find relevant datasets for reuse
dataset search engines can present a snippet for each retrieved dataset to explain dataset search engines relevance to the users data needs
this emerging problem of snippet generation for dataset search has not received much research attention
to provide a basis for future research we introduce a framework for quantitatively evaluating the quality of a dataset snippet
the proposed metrics assess the extent to which a snippet matches the query intent
the proposed metrics assess the extent to which a snippet covers the main content of each retrieved dataset to explain its relevance to the users data needs
to establish a baseline we perform an empirical evaluation based on realworld datasets and queries
to establish a baseline we adapt four stateoftheart methods from related fields to we problem
we also conduct a user study to verify we findings
the results demonstrate the effectiveness of we evaluation framework
the results suggest directions for future research
