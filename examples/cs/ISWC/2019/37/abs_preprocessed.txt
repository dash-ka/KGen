Link prediction has recently been a major focus of knowledge graphs

the triples provide less information than the paths
Most previous works only consider the triples
Although some works consider ie similar entities get similar representations  of the paths some works ignore the syntactic information  of the paths
Although some works consider the semantic information  of the paths some works ignore ie the order of entities  of the paths

In this paper we propose a novel approach for link prediction
In this paper we propose RWLMLM 
RWLMLM consists of a random walk algorithm for a major focus of knowledge graph 
RWLMLM consists of a random walk algorithm for a major focus of KG 
RWLMLM consists of a random walk algorithm for a language modelbased link prediction model
The paths generated by KG
The paths are viewed as pseudosentences for modelbased link prediction model training

Experimental results show that our method outperforms several stateoftheart models on benchmark datasets
Further analysis shows that our model is highly parameter efficient
