the wikipedias category graph has been used extensively for tasks like semantic similarity estimation
the wikipedias category graph serves as the taxonomic backbone for largescale knowledge graphs like yago
the wikipedias category graph serves as the taxonomic backbone for largescale knowledge graphs like probase
the wikipedias category graph has been used extensively for tasks like entity disambiguation
wikipedias categories are a rich source of nontaxonomic information
wikipedias categories are a rich source of taxonomic information
the category their nationality science fiction writers for example encodes genre  science fiction 
the category their nationality science fiction writers for example encodes the type of wikipedias resources  science fiction 
the category their nationality science fiction writers for example encodes their nationality  science fiction 
several approaches in the literature make use of fractions of this
this encoded information without exploiting wikipedias full potential
category axioms that uses information from category instances
category axioms that uses information from the category network
in this paper we introduce an approach for the discovery of category axioms
category axioms that uses information from category instances lexicalisations
with dbpedia as background knowledge
we discover 703k axioms covering 502k of wikipedias categories
33 m type assertions at more than 87 percent respectively
we populate the dbpedia knowledge graph with additional 44 m relation assertions
33 m type assertions at 90 percent precision respectively
