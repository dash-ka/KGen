Knowledge graphs are composed of literal nodes
Knowledge graphs are composed of entity nodes
Knowledge graphs are composed of different elements
Knowledge graphs are composed of relation edges
Each literal node contains an entitys attribute value 
Each literal node contains eg the height of an entity of type person 
information which in general can not be represented by relations between entities alone
Each literal node thereby encodes information
However most of the existing embedding only consider relation edges
However most of the existing embedding only consider entity nodes
the information provided by literals into account
However latentfeaturebased methods for knowledge graph analysis only consider entity nodes
However latentfeaturebased methods for knowledge graph analysis only consider relation edges
However latentfeaturebased methods for knowledge graph analysis only thus do not take the information
However most of the existing embedding only thus do not take the information
literals which we name LiteralE
In this paper we extend existing latent feature methods for link prediction by a simple portable module for incorporating literals
concurrent methods where literals are incorporated by adding a literaldependent term to the output of the scoring function
concurrent methods where literals are affect the entity embeddings
Unlike in concurrent methods LiteralE directly enriches these embeddings with information from literals via a learnable parametrized function
a learnable parametrized function learned along with the entity embeddings in an endtoend manner
a learnable parametrized function can be easily integrated into the scoring function of existing methods
In an extensive empirical study over three datasets we evaluate LiteralEextended versions of various stateoftheart latent feature methods for link prediction and demonstrate that LiteralE presents an effective way to improve three datasets performance
three datasets literals which we publicly provide as testbeds for further research
For these experiments we augmented standard datasets with three datasets literals
Moreover we show that it can be easily extended to handle literals from different modalities
Moreover we show that LiteralE leads to an qualitative improvement of the embeddings
