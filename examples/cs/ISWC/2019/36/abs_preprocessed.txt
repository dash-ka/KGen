Despite the growing popularity of knowledge graphs for managing diverse data at large scale users are often expected to know how entities of interest are described in the graph
Despite the growing popularity of knowledge graphs for managing diverse data at large scale users are often expected to know how to formulate queries in a language such as SPARQL
users who wish to pose expressive queries against such graphs
an interactive graphbased exploration that allows nonexpert users to simultaneously query knowledge graphs
In this paper we propose a language the languages operators are based on an interactive graphbased exploration we compare the expressivity of this language with SPARQL
a language that relaxes these expectations
an interactive graphbased exploration that allows nonexpert users to simultaneously navigate knowledge graphs
We then discuss an implementation of this language with SPARQL that We call RDF Explorer such as avoiding interactions
interactions that lead to empty results
We then discuss an implementation of this language with SPARQL that We discuss various desirable properties Explorer has such as avoiding interactions
Through a user study over the Wikidata knowledgegraph We show that users successfully complete more tasks with RDF than with the existing Wikidata Query Helper while a usability questionnaire demonstrates that users generally prefer our tool and selfreport lower levels of frustration effort
