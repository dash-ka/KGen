Ontologybased data access is a popular approach for integrating multiple data sources by means of an ontology
Ontologybased data access is a popular approach for querying multiple data sources by means of an ontology
an ontology which is usually expressed in a description logic of DLLite family
The conventional semantics of Ontologybased data access and DLs is setbased that is duplicates are disregarded
multiset  semantics which is especially important for the correct evaluation of aggregate queries
the standard database bag  semantics which is especially important for the correct evaluation of aggregate queries
This disagrees with the standard database bag  semantics
This disagrees with multiset  semantics
In this article we study two variants of bag semantics for query answering over  textitDLLite  mathcalF  extending basic  with functional roles

our first semantics which follows the semantics of primary keys in SQL
the semantics of primary keys in SQL conjunctive query RRB answering is in TC  that TC  for the restricted class of rooted CQs such CQs are also rewritable to the bag relational algebra
the semantics of primary keys in SQL conjunctive query RRB answering is in TC  that TC  for the restricted class of rooted CQs such CQs are also rewritable to the bag relational algebra
For our first semantics conjunctive query answering is coNPhard in data complexity in general such CQs are also rewritable to the bag relational algebra
ontologies identified by a new notion of functional weak acyclicity
For our second semantics
the results are the same except that TC membership
rewritability hold only for the restricted class of ontologies
