ontology design patterns have been proposed to facilitate ontology engineering
the often claimed benefits provided by odps
despite numerous conceptual contributions for over more than a decade there is little empirical work to support the often claimed benefits
determining ontology design patterns use from ontologies alone  without other supporting documentation  is challenging as there is or required  mechanism for stipulating the intended use of an ontology design patterns
determining ontology design patterns use from ontologies alone  without interviews  is challenging as there is no standard  mechanism for stipulating the intended use of an ontology design patterns

modelling features which are suggestive of a given ontology design
instead we must rely on modelling features patternss influence
for the purpose of determining the prevalence of odps in ontologies we developed a variety of these techniques to detect these features with varying degrees of liberality
using these techniques we survey bioportal with respect to wellknown repositories for odps
using these techniques we survey bioportal with respect to publicly available repositories for odps
we findings are predominantly negative
for the vast majority of odps we can not find empirical evidence for the vast majority of odps use in biomedical ontologies
