quantities appear in companies with annual revenue of at least 50 mio usd athletes
athletes who ran 200 m faster than 195 s electric cars with range above 400 miles and so on
quantities appear in search queries in numerous forms  athletes
processing such queries requires the understanding of numbers present in the query to capture the contextual information about the queried entities
queries that involve entities
qa systems can handle queries
