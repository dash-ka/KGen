knowledge graphs have become ubiquitous data knowledge graphs utility has been amplified by the research on ability to answer carefully crafted questions over knowledge graphs
knowledge graphs have become ubiquitous data sources utility has been amplified by the research on ability to answer carefully crafted questions over knowledge graphs
we investigate the problem of question generation over knowledge graphs wherein the level of difficulty of the question can be controlled
we present an endtoend neural networkbased method for automatic generation of complex multihop questions over knowledge graphs
taking an answer as input we transformerbased model generates a natural language question
taking a subgraph as input we transformerbased model generates a natural language question
our transformerbased model makes use of this estimation to generate difficultycontrollable questions
our transformerbased model incorporates difficulty estimation based on named entity popularity
we evaluate our transformerbased model on two recent multihop qa datasets
we evaluation shows that our transformerbased model is able to generate highquality questions
we evaluation shows that our transformerbased model is able to generate fluent questions
we evaluation shows that our transformerbased model is able to generate relevant questions
