in this paper we target the problem of event series completion in a knowledge graph
realworld events that happened as a part of event series
we address two tasks inference of realworld events
realworld events that are missing in the knowledge graph
we address two tasks prediction of subevent relations
to address these problems we proposed supervised happening approach leverages structural features of event series
happening does not require any external knowledge the characteristics
the characteristics making it unique in the context of event inference
we experimental evaluation demonstrates that happening outperforms the baselines by 44
we experimental evaluation demonstrates that happening outperforms the baselines 52 percent points in terms of precision for the subevent prediction
we experimental evaluation demonstrates that happening outperforms the baselines 52 percent points in terms of the inference tasks correspondingly
