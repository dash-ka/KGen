an empirical study aiming at understanding the modeling style
this paper presents an empirical study
an empirical study aiming at understanding the overall semantic structure of linked open data
we observe how individuals are used in practice
we observe how classes are used in practice
we observe how properties are used in practice
we also investigate how hierarchies of concepts are structured
we also investigate how much hierarchies of concepts are linked
an open source implementation that facilitates this paper application to other linked data knowledge graphs
metrics which generalises over an open source implementation
in addition to discussing the results this paper contributes a set of metrics
metrics which generalises over the observable constructs
in addition to discussing the results this paper contributes a conceptual framework
