efficient ontology reuse is a key factor in the semantic web to enable the interoperability of computing systems
one important aspect of ontology reuse is concerned with ranking most relevant ontologies based on a keyword query
apart from the semantic match of query the stateoftheart often relies on ontologies occurrences in the linked open data cloud to determine relevance
apart from the semantic match of ontology the stateoftheart often relies on ontologies occurrences in the linked open data cloud to determine relevance
we observe that ontologies of some application domains in particular those related to web of things often do not appear in the underlying linked open data datasets used to define ontologies popularity
ontologies popularity resulting in ineffective ranking scores
this motivated us to investigate based on the problematic things case whether the scope of ranking models can be extended by relying on qualitative attributes instead of an explicit popularity feature
a ranking model that uses ontologies popularity as prediction target for the relevance degree
we propose a novel approach to ontology ranking by selecting a range of relevant qualitative features
we propose a novel approach to ontology ranking by proposing a popularity measure for ontologies
testing ontologies on independent datasets derived from the stateoftheart
we propose a novel approach to ontology ranking by confirming ontologies validity by testing ontologies on independent datasets
we propose a novel approach to ontology ranking by training a ranking model
ontologies based on scholarly data
we find that qualitative features help to improve the prediction of the relevance degree in terms of popularity
we further discuss the influence of these features on the ranking model
