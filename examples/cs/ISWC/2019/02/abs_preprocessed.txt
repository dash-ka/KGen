Modelbased approaches to recommendation can recommend items with a very high level of accuracy
Unfortunately even when the model embeds contentbased information if we move to a latent space we miss references to the actual semantics of recommended items
Consequently this makes nontrivial the interpretation of a recommendation process
semantic features coming from a knowledge graph in order to train an interpretable model
In this paper we show how to initialize latent factors in Factorization Machines by using semantic features
With we semantic features are injected into the learning process to retain the original informativeness of the items available in the dataset
The accuracy and effectiveness of the trained model have been tested using two wellknown recommender systems datasets
the information encoded in the original knowledge graph
By relying on the information we have also evaluated the semantic accuracy and robustness for the knowledgeaware interpretability of the final model
