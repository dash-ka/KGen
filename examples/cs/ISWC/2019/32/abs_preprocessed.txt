analytical queries are queries with numerical aggregators computing the average number of objects per property identifying the most frequent subjects
such queries are essential to monitor the content of the linked open data cloud
such queries are essential to monitor the quality
many analytical queries can not be executed directly on the sparql endpoints because the fair use policy cuts off expensive queries
in this paper we show how to rewrite such queries into a set of queries that each satisfy the fair use policy
we then show how to execute these queries in such a way that the result provably converges to the exact query answer
we algorithm is an anytime algorithm
an anytime algorithm meaning that our algorithm can give intermediate approximate results at any time point
we experiments show that the approach converges rapidly towards the exact solution
we experiments show that the approach can compute even complex indicators at the scale of the linked open data cloud
