Any data publisher can make RDF knowledge graphs available for consumption on the Web
the decentralized publishing paradigm underlying the Data Web
the Data Web which has led to more than 150 billion facts on more than 3 billion things
This is a direct consequence of the decentralized publishing paradigm
more than 3 billion things being published on the Web in more than 10000 RDF knowledge graphs over the last decade
However the success of this publishing paradigm also means that the validation of the facts contained in RDF knowledge graphs has become more important than ever before
Several families of fact validation algorithms have been developed over the last years to address several settings of the fact validation problems
In this paper we consider the following fact validation setting Given an RDF knowledge graph compute the likelihood that a given  novel  fact is true
None of the current solutions to this problem exploits RDFS semantics especially domain class subsumption information
None of the current solutions to this problem exploits RDFS semantics especially domain range subsumption information
We address this research gap by presenting an unsupervised approach dubbed COPAAL that extracts paths from knowledge graphs to corroborate  novel  input facts
We approach relies on a mutual information measure
the RDFS semantics underlying the knowledge graph into consideration
a mutual information measure that takes the RDFS semantics
the information shared by predicates within the knowledge graph to compute the likelihood of a fact
In particular We use the information
a fact being corroborated by the knowledge graph
the information shared by paths within the knowledge graph to compute the likelihood of a fact
We evaluate We approach extensively using 17 publicly available datasets
We results indicate that We approach outperforms the state of the art unsupervised approaches significantly by up to 015 AUCROC
We even outperform supervised approaches by up to 007 AUCROC
