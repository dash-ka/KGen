several centralised rdf systems support datalog reasoning by precomputing all logically implied triples
all logically implied triples using the wellknown seminaive algorithm
several centralised rdf systems support datalog reasoning by storing all logically implied triples
a common solution is to distribute large rdf datasets in a cluster of sharednothing servers
large rdf datasets often exceed the capacity of centralised rdf systems
numerous distributed query answering techniques
while numerous are known distributed seminaive evaluation of arbitrary datalog rules is less understood
in fact most distributed support no reasoning
in fact most distributed rdf stores
in fact most can handle only limited datalog fragments
in this paper we extend the dynamic data exchange approach for distributed query answering by potter et al
to a reasoning algorithm that can handle arbitrary rules while preserving important properties such as nonrepetition of inferences
we also show empirically that we algorithm scales well to very large rdf datasets
