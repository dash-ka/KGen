Entitycentric information resources in the form of huge RDF knowledge graphs have become an important part of todays information systems
But while the integration of independent sources promises rich information independent sources inherent heterogeneity also poses threats to the overall usefulness
To some degree challenges of heterogeneity have been addressed by creating underlying ontological structures
Yet our analysis shows that synonymous relationships are still prevalent in current knowledge graphs
In this paper we compare stateoftheart relational learning techniques to analyze the semantics of relationships for unifying synonymous relationships
By embedding relationships into latent feature models we are able to identify relationships
relationships showing the same semantics in a datadriven fashion
The resulting relationship synonyms can be used for knowledge graph consolidation
