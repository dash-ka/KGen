that querying huge knowledge bases
knowing huge knowledge bases is an essential longterm goal to guarantee that
completely insufficiently informed
having cardinality constraints for roles would be an important advance to distinguish correctly
those having data either incorrect
completely described individuals from those
each concept when the knowledge bases exists
in this paper we propose a method for automatically discovering from the knowledge bases content the maximum cardinality of roles for each concept
a method is robust thanks to the use of hoeffdings inequality
pruning properties that drastically reduce the search space
a knowledge base benefiting from pruning properties
we also design an algorithm for an exhaustive search of such constraints in a knowledge base
an algorithm named c3m
experiments conducted on dbpedia
also highlight the robustness of we method with a precision higher than 95 percent
experiments demonstrate the scaling up of c3m
