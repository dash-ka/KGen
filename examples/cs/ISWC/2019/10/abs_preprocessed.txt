huge knowledge bases whose content has been generated from collaborative platforms
Semantic Web connects huge knowledge bases
huge knowledge bases whose content has been generated by integration of heterogeneous databases
huge knowledge bases whose content has been generated from collaborative platforms
huge knowledge bases whose content has been generated by integration of heterogeneous databases
Naturally huge knowledge bases are incomplete
Naturally huge knowledge bases contain erroneous data
huge knowledge bases whose content has been generated from collaborative platforms and by integration of heterogeneous databases data quality
huge knowledge bases whose content has been generated from collaborative platforms and by integration of heterogeneous databases returns reliable results
that querying huge knowledge bases
Knowing huge knowledge bases is an essential longterm goal to guarantee that
those having data either incorrect
completely insufficiently informed
Having cardinality constraints for roles would be an important advance to distinguish correctly
completely described individuals from those
each concept when the knowledge bases exists
In this paper we propose a method for automatically discovering from the knowledge bases content the maximum cardinality of roles for each concept
a method is robust thanks to the use of Hoeffdings inequality
a knowledge base benefiting from pruning properties
We also design an algorithm for an exhaustive search of such constraints in a knowledge base
an algorithm named C3M
pruning properties that drastically reduce the search space
Experiments demonstrate the scaling up of C3M
also highlight the robustness of We method with a precision higher than 95 percent
