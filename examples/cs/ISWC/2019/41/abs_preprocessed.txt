correspondences that map between two agents respective ontologies
in the distributed ontology alignment construction problem two agents agree upon a meaningful subset of correspondences
however an agent may be tempted to manipulate the negotiation in favour of a preferred alignment by misrepresenting the weight or confidence of the exchanged correspondences
therefore such an agreement can only be meaningful if the agents can be incentivised to be honest when revealing information
valuations associated with this problem
we examine this problem and model this problem on an edgeweighted bipartite graph where each agent maintains a private set of valuations
we examine this problem and model this problem on an edgeweighted bipartite graph where each side of the graph represents each agents private entities

the objective is to find a matching
a matching that maximises the agents social welfare
we study implementations in dominant strategies
we show that implementations in dominant strategies should be solved optimally if truthful mechanisms are required
a decentralised version of the greedy allocation algorithm is then studied with a firstprice payment rule proving tight bounds on the price of stability
