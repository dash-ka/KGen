to ensure both a uniform coverage of the different topics it is crucial to identify underrepresented classes in the knowledge graph
to ensure both the completeness of the data it is crucial to identify underrepresented classes in the knowledge graph
in this paper we tackle this problem by developing statistical techniques for class cardinality estimation in collaborative knowledge graph platforms
we method is able to estimate the completeness of a class as defined by a schema or ontology hence can be used to answer questions such as  does the knowledge base have a complete list of all beer brands  volcanos  video game consoles

as a usecase we focus on wikidata

we observe that the number and frequency of unique class instances drastically influence the performance of an estimator because some estimators to overestimate the true size of the class if some estimators are not properly handled

we observe that the number and frequency of unique class instances drastically influence the performance of bursts of inserts because some estimators to overestimate the true size of the class if some estimators are not properly handled
one can effectively measure the convergence of a class towards its true size by considering the stability of an estimator against the number of available instances
