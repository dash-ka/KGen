To ensure both a uniform coverage of the different topics it is crucial to identify underrepresented classes in the Knowledge Graph
To ensure both the completeness of the data it is crucial to identify underrepresented classes in the Knowledge Graph
In this paper we tackle this problem by developing statistical techniques for class cardinality estimation in collaborative Knowledge Graph platforms
we method is able to estimate the completeness of a class as defined by a schema or ontology hence can be used to answer questions such as  Does the knowledge base have a complete list of all Beer Brands  Volcanos  Video Game Consoles

As a usecase we focus on Wikidata

we techniques are applied to the case of graphs
we techniques are derived from species estimation
we techniques are derived from datamanagement methodologies
we techniques are applied to the case of collaborative editing
In we empirical evaluation
one can effectively measure the convergence of a class towards its true size by considering the stability of an estimator against the number of available instances
we observe that the number and frequency of unique class instances drastically influence the performance of bursts of inserts because some estimators to overestimate the true size of the class if some estimators are not properly handled
