With the continuously growing amount of data users are often overwhelmed by the amount of potentially relevant information and entities
data offered in the form of knowledge graphs
Hence helping users find relevant data is a problem
a problem that becomes more
a problem that becomes more important
Skyline queries are typically used in multicriteria decision
multicriteria decision making applications to find a set of objects
objects that are of interest to a user
This type of queries has been extensively studied over relational data in the database community
But only little attention has yet been paid to investigating if the skyline principle can help identifying sets of interesting entities in knowledge graphs
But only little attention has yet been paid to investigating how the skyline principle can help identifying sets of interesting entities in knowledge graphs
In this paper we therefore show how the skyline principle can help the user find interesting entities
In this paper we therefore show how the skyline principle can be applied to RDF knowledge graphs
algorithms using commonly used standard interfaces for accessing RDF data
In particular we present algorithms to process skyline queries
In particular we present a lightweight extension of existing interfaces to process skyline queries
we experiments show that a lightweight extension of a lightweight extension of existing interfaces RRB enable efficient skyline query processing over knowledge graphs
