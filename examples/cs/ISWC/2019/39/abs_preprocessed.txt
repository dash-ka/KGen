The launch of the new Google News in 2018 introduced the Frequently asked questions feature to structurally summarize the news story in The launch of the new Google News in 2018 full coverage page
While news summarization has been a research topic for decades this new feature is poised to usher in a new line of news summarization techniques
data associated with the news story
There are two fundamental approaches learning the questions from the content of the news story directly
There are two fundamental approaches mining the questions from data
a learning based approach to generate a structured summary of news articles with answer pairs to capture salient aspects of the news story
a learning based approach to generate a structured summary of news articles with question pairs to capture interesting aspects of the news story
a learning based approach to generate a structured summary of news articles with answer pairs to capture interesting aspects of the news story
This paper provides the first study to the best of our knowledge of a learning
a learning based approach to generate a structured summary of news articles with question pairs to capture salient aspects of the news story
multiple natural language questions corresponding to each snippet
Specifically this learningbased approach generates multiple natural language questions
Specifically this learningbased approach predicts a news article attention map
Specifically this learningbased approach reads a news article
Furthermore we describe a miningbased approach as the mechanism to generate weak supervision data for training the learning
the learning based approach
We evaluate We approach on a large dataset with 91K news articles We constructed
We evaluate We approach on the existing SQuAD dataset We constructed
We show that We proposed system can achieve an AUC of 0734 for document attention map prediction for question summarization beating stateofart baselines
We show that We proposed system can achieve an AUC of a BLEU4 score of 1246 for natural question generation for question summarization beating stateofart baselines
We show that We proposed system can achieve an AUC of a BLEU4 score of 244 for question summarization beating stateofart baselines
