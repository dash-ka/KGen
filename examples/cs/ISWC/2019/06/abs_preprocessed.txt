ontologybased knowledge bases rrb like dbpedia usefulness and usability are limited by various quality issues
ontologybased knowledge bases like dbpedia are very valuable resources
one such issue is the use of string literals instead of semantically typed entities
replacing the literal with an existing entity from the ontologybased knowledge base
a new entity that is typed using classes from the ontologybased knowledge base
in this paper we study the automated canonicalization of such literals
replacing the literal with a new entity
we evaluate this framework against stateoftheart baselines for both semantic typing
we propose a framework
a framework that combines both reasoning learning in order to predict the relevant entities and types
