Ontologybased knowledge bases RRB like DBpedia usefulness and usability are limited by various quality issues
Ontologybased knowledge bases like DBpedia are very valuable resources
One such issue is the use of string literals instead of semantically typed entities
a new entity that is typed using classes from the Ontologybased knowledge base
In this paper we study the automated canonicalization of such literals
replacing the literal with a new entity
replacing the literal with an existing entity from the Ontologybased knowledge base
a framework that combines both machine learning in order to predict the relevant entities and types
We propose a framework
We evaluate this framework against stateoftheart baselines for both semantic typing
We evaluate this framework against stateoftheart baselines for both entity matching
a framework that combines both reasoning learning in order to predict the relevant entities and types
