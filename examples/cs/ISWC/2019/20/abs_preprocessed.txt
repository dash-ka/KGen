We propose a new endtoend method for extending a Knowledge Graph from tables
Existing techniques tend to tend to extract many redundant facts
Existing techniques tend to interpret tables by focusing on information Knowledge Graph
information that is already in the a
We method aims to find more novel facts
We introduce a new technique for table interpretation based on a scalable graphical model
a scalable graphical model using entity similarities
Our method further disambiguates cell values using a Knowledge Graph embeddings as additional ranking method
Other distinctive features are the lack of assumptions about the underlying a Knowledge Graph
Other distinctive features are the lack of the enabling of a finegrained tuning of the precisionrecall tradeoff of extracted facts
We experiments show that We approach is more resistant against the bias
We experiments show that We approach has a higher recall during the interpretation process than the stateoftheart
the bias observed in extracting mostly redundant facts since the stateoftheart produces more novel extractions
