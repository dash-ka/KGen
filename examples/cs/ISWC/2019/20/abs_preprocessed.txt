we propose a new endtoend method for extending a knowledge graph from tables
existing techniques tend to tend to extract many redundant facts
information that is already in the a
existing techniques tend to interpret tables by focusing on information knowledge graph
we method aims to find more novel facts
a scalable graphical model using entity similarities
we introduce a new technique for table interpretation based on a scalable graphical model
our method further disambiguates cell values using a knowledge graph embeddings as additional ranking method
other distinctive features are the lack of assumptions about the underlying a knowledge graph
other distinctive features are the lack of the enabling of a finegrained tuning of the precisionrecall tradeoff of extracted facts
we experiments show that we approach has a higher recall during the interpretation process than the stateoftheart
we experiments show that we approach is more resistant against the bias
the bias observed in extracting mostly redundant facts since the stateoftheart produces more novel extractions
