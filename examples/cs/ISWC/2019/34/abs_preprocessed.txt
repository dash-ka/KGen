Learning knowledge graph embeddings has received increasing attention in recent years
Most embedding models in literature interpret relations as bilinear mapping functions to operate on entity embeddings
Most embedding models in literature interpret relations as linear mapping functions to operate on entity embeddings
However we find that such relationlevel modeling can not capture the diverse relational structures of KGs well
a novel edgecentric embedding model TransEdge which contextualizes relation representations in terms of specific headtail entity pairs
In this paper we propose a novel edgecentric embedding model TransEdge
We refer to such interpret representations of a relation as translations between entity embeddings
We refer to such contextualized representations of a relation as edge embeddings
a novel edgecentric embedding model TransEdge achieves promising performance on different prediction tasks
TransEdge which contextualizes relation representations in terms of specific headtail entity pairs
TransEdge which contextualizes relation representations in terms of specific headtail entity pairs
We experiments on benchmark datasets indicate that a novel edgecentric embedding model TransEdge obtains the stateoftheart results on embeddingbased entity alignment
TransEdge which contextualizes relation representations in terms of specific headtail entity pairs
We also show that a novel edgecentric embedding model TransEdge is complementary with conventional entity alignment methods
TransEdge which contextualizes relation representations in terms of specific headtail entity pairs
Moreover a novel edgecentric embedding model TransEdge shows very competitive performance on link prediction
