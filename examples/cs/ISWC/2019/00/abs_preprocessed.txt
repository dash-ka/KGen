despite the prospect of a vast web of interlinked data the semantic web today mostly fails to meet semantic web potential
semantic web current architecture which totally relies on the availability of the servers
the availability of the servers providing access to the data
one of the main problems semantic web faces is rooted in semantic web current architecture
the servers are subject to failures
situations where some data is unavailable
failures which often results in situations
decentralized peertopeer based architectures to alleviate this problem
recent advances have proposed decentralized peertopeer
however for query processing these approaches mostly rely on flooding a standard technique for peertopeer systems and hence because high query response times
peertopeer systems which can easily result in very high network traffic
to still enable efficient query processing in such networks this paper proposes two indexing schemes locational indexes
to still enable efficient query processing in such networks this paper proposes two indexing schemes prefixpartitioned bloom filters
two indexing schemes which in a decentralized fashion aim at efficiently finding nodes with relevant data for a given query
our experiments show that such indexing schemes are able to considerably speed up query processing times compared to existing approaches
