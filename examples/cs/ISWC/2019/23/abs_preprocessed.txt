Link keys are recently introduced to formalize data
data interlinking between data sources
Link keys are considered as a new kind of correspondences
correspondences included in ontology alignments
We propose a procedure for reasoning in a decentralized manner on a network of ontologies with alignments
alignments containing link keys
the ontologies involved in such a network
link key correspondences equipped with a loose semantics
In this paper the ontologies are expressed in mathcal ALC  while the alignments can contain individual
In this paper the ontologies are expressed in the logic  while the alignments can contain individual
In this paper the ontologies are expressed in mathcal ALC  while the alignments can contain concept
In this paper the ontologies are expressed in the logic  while the alignments can contain concept
In this paper the ontologies are expressed in mathcal ALC  while the alignments can contain link key correspondences
In this paper the ontologies are expressed in the logic  while the alignments can contain link key correspondences
The decentralized aspect of our procedure is based on a process of knowledge propagation through the network via correspondences
a process of knowledge propagation allows to reduce polynomially global reasoning to local reasoning
