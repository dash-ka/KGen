rdf has been recently introduced as a w3c recommendation to define constraints
constraints that can be validated against rdf graphs
interactions of shacl with other semantic web technologies such as ontologies is a matter of ongoing research

inference rules expressed in datalog
in this paper we study the interaction of a subset of shacl with inference rules
on the one hand shacl constraints can be used to define a  schema  for graph datasets
on the other hand inference rules can lead to the discovery of new facts
new facts that do not match the original schema
given a set of datalog rules we present a method to detect which constraints could be violated by the application of the inference rules on some graph instance of the original schema and update the original schema ie the set of shacl constraints in order to capture the new facts
