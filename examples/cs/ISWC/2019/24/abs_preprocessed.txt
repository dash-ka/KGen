the vast majority of Many methods focus on finding plausible missing facts graph triples in particular
Many methods have been proposed to automatically extend knowledge bases
the vast majority of Many methods focus on finding plausible knowledge graph triples in particular
In this paper we instead focus on automatically extending ontologies
ontologies that are encoded as a set of existential rules
rules that are plausible
In particular we aim is to find rules
In particular we aim which can not be deduced from the given ontology
To this end we propose a graphbased representation of rule bases
the considered graphs
Nodes of the correspond to predicates
Nodes of the are annotated with The vectors
the considered graphs
The vectors may be obtained from external resources such as word embeddings could be estimated from the rule base the rule base itself
The vectors may be obtained from external resources such as The vectors could be estimated from the rule base the rule base itself
Edges connect predicates that cooccur in The vectors annotations reflect the types of rules in which the predicates cooccur
Edges connect predicates that cooccur in the same rule reflect the types of rules in which the predicates cooccur
predictive of which rules are plausible
a neural network model based on Graph Convolutional Networks to refine the initial vector representation of the predicates to obtain a representation
We then use a neural network model
a representation which is predictive
We present experimental results
