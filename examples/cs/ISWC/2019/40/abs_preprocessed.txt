this work studies the task of automatically classifying products into a universal categorisation taxonomy using products markup data
markup data published on the web
we best performing model can significantly improve state of the art on this task by up to 96 percent points in macroaverage f1
despite the highly heterogeneous nature of the sitespecific categories the sitespecific categories can be used as very effective features even only by the sitespecific categories for the classification task
using three new neural network models adapted based on previous work we show that
using three new neural network models adapted based on previous work we analyse the effect of different kinds of product markup data on this task
