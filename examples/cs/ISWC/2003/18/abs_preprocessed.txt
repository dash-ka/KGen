This paper introduces an embedded component
This paper introduces the DAMLS Virtual Machine
an embedded component that uses the DAMLS Process Model to control the interaction between Web services
We provide a proof of the validity of the implementation of the DAMLS Virtual Machine by proving a mapping from the rules
the rules used by The the DAMLS Virtual Machine to the DAMLS Operational Semantics
an empirical evaluation that shows that the overhead is only a small fraction of the time
We provide an example of use of the the DAMLS Virtual Machine with a DAMLSized version of Amazoncoms Web service
the time required by a query to Amazoncoms
Finally
We conclude with an empirical evaluation
the overhead required by The the DAMLS Virtual Machine during the interaction with Amazoncoms
The the DAMLS Virtual Machine provides crucial evidence that DAMLS can be effectively used to manage the interaction between Web Services
