Both requirements are met by the respective outcomes of knowledge engineering initiatives
Both requirements are met by the respective outcomes of ontological engineering initiatives
service composition  which draws on the functionality of semantic web services to expose available resources
resource synthesis  which draws on the functionality of semantic web services to expose available resources
In this paper we discuss a novel knowledgebased approach to service composition 
service composition  which draws on the functionality of semantic web services to represent available resources
resource synthesis  which draws on the functionality of semantic web services to represent available resources
In this paper we discuss a novel knowledgebased approach to resource synthesis 
a novel knowledgebased approach we use exploits domain knowledge to guide the service composition process
a novel knowledgebased approach we use exploits domain knowledge to provide advice on service selection and instantiation
a prototype workflow construction environment that supports the runtime recommendation of a service solution
a novel knowledgebased approach has been implemented in a prototype workflow construction environment
a prototype workflow construction environment that supports knowledgebased configuration of selected services
a prototype workflow construction environment that supports service discovery via semantic service descriptions
The use of knowledge provides a basis for full automation of service composition via conventional planning algorithms
Workflows can be executed through a domainspecific direct mapping mechanism
Workflows can be executed via a more fluid approach such as WSDLbased service grounding
Workflows produced by this system
a more fluid approach such as WSDLbased service grounding have been used to demonstrate practical benefits in the context of the Geodise initiative
