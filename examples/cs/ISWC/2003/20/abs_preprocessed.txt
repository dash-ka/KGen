resource synthesis  which draws on the functionality of semantic web services to expose available resources
service composition  which draws on the functionality of semantic web services to represent available resources

resource synthesis  which draws on the functionality of semantic web services to represent available resources
in this paper we discuss a novel knowledgebased approach to service composition 
in this paper we discuss a novel knowledgebased approach to resource synthesis 
a novel knowledgebased approach we use exploits domain knowledge to provide advice on service selection and instantiation
a novel knowledgebased approach we use exploits domain knowledge to guide the service composition process
a prototype workflow construction environment that supports service discovery via semantic service descriptions
a novel knowledgebased approach has been implemented in a prototype workflow construction environment
a prototype workflow construction environment that supports the runtime recommendation of a service solution
a prototype workflow construction environment that supports knowledgebased configuration of selected services
the use of knowledge provides a basis for full automation of service composition via conventional planning algorithms
workflows can be executed through a domainspecific direct mapping mechanism
workflows produced by this system
workflows can be executed via a more fluid approach such as wsdlbased service grounding
a more fluid approach such as wsdlbased service grounding have been used to demonstrate practical benefits in the context of the geodise initiative
