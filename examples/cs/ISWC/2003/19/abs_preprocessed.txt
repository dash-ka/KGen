in this paper we implemented infrastructure augmented with semantic descriptions of heterogeneous web services functionalities
in this paper we describe internet reasoning service  a framework
infrastructure whose main goal is to support the publication location composition and execution of heterogeneous web services
in this paper we describe irsii  a framework
irsii has three main classes of features
features which distinguish this paper from other work on semantic web services
firstly this paper supports oneclick publishing of standalone software irsii automatically creates the appropriate wrappers given pointers to the standalone code
secondly this paper explicitly distinguishes as a result supports dynamic knowledgebased service selection
secondly this paper explicitly distinguishes as a result supports capabilitydriven service invocation
secondly this paper explicitly distinguishes between tasks  what to do 
secondly this paper explicitly distinguishes between methods  how to achieve tasks 
secondly this paper explicitly distinguishes as a result supports flexible mappings between services
secondly this paper explicitly distinguishes as a result supports flexible mappings between problem specifications
finally
irsii services are web service compatible
any irsii service automatically appears as a standard web service to other web service infrastructures
standard web services can be trivially published through the irsii
in this paper we illustrate the main functionalities of irsii through a scenario involving a distributed application in the healthcare domain
