we expected to  publish  this ontology on the semantic web using owl with relatively little effort
however we ran into a number of problems concerning alternative interpretations of the sn notation
however we ran into a number of problems concerning the inability to express some of the interpretations in owl
we detail these problems as a cautionary tale to others of criteria for evaluating alternative representations
others planning to publish preexisting ontologies on the semantic web as a list of issues to consider when describing formally concepts in any ontology
alternative representations which could form part of a methodology of ontology development
