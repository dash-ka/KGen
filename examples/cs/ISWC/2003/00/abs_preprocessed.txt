We expected to  publish  this ontology on the Semantic Web using OWL with relatively little effort
However We ran into a number of problems concerning the inability to express some of the interpretations in OWL
However We ran into a number of problems concerning alternative interpretations of the SN notation
We detail these problems as a cautionary tale as a collection of criteria for evaluating alternative representations
others planning to publish preexisting ontologies on the Semantic Web as a list of issues to consider when describing formally concepts in any ontology
We detail these problems as a cautionary tale to others of criteria for evaluating alternative representations
alternative representations which could form part of a methodology of ontology development
