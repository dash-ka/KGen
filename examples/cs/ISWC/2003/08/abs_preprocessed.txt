semantic coordination namely the problem of finding an agreement on the meaning of heterogeneous semantic models is one of the key issues in the development of the semantic web
in this paper we propose a new algorithm for discovering semantic mappings across hierarchical classifications
hierarchical classifications based on a new approach to semantic coordination
a new approach shifts the problem of semantic coordination from the problem of computing linguistic similarities  what most other proposed approaches do  to the problem of deducing relations between sets of logical formulae
a new approach shifts the problem of semantic coordination from the problem of computing structural similarities  what most other proposed approaches do  to the problem of deducing relations between sets of logical formulae
concepts belonging to different models
logical formulae that represent the meaning of concepts
we show how to present the results of preliminary tests on two types of catalogs
we show how to apply a new approach to an interesting family of semantic models namely hierarchical classifications
we show how to present the results of preliminary tests on two types of hierarchical classifications
we show how to present the results of preliminary tests on two types of web directories
we show how to apply a new algorithm to an interesting family of semantic models namely hierarchical classifications
finally we argue why this is a significant improvement on previous approaches
