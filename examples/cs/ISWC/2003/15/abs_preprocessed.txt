one of the challenging problems that web service technology faces is the ability to effectively discover services based on web service technology capabilities
we present an approach to tackle this problem in the context of damls ontologies of services
the proposed approach enables to select the combinations of web services that best match a given request effectively computes the extra information with respect to q  the information required by a service request 
the proposed approach enables to select the combinations of web services that best match a given request q
the proposed approach enables to select the combinations of web services that best match a given request effectively computes the extra information with respect to q  eg 
the proposed approach enables to select the combinations of web services that best match a given request effectively computes the extra information with respect to q  the information not provided by any existing service 
we study the reasoning problem
we propose an algorithm
an algorithm derived from hypergraphs theory
the reasoning problem associated with such a matching process
