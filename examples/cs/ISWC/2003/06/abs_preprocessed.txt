RDFS represents nowadays the core SW language for creating resource descriptions worldwide
RDFS represents nowadays the core SW language for exchanging resource descriptions worldwide
Unfortunately fullfledged view definition languages for the RDFS data model are still missing
We propose RVL a view definition language capable of creating not only virtual RDFS schemas from classes properties resource descriptions available on the Semantic Web
