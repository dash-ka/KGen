we study the problem of interoperability among xml data sources
we propose a lightweight infrastructure for this purpose
this purpose that derives its inspiration from the recent semantic web initiative inspiration from the recent semantic web initiative
this purpose that derives a lightweight infrastructure for this purpose
we approach is based on enriching local sources with semantic declarations so as to enable interoperability
semantic declarations expose the semantics of the information content of sources by mapping the concepts present therein to a common  application specific  vocabulary in the spirit of rdf
tools that may assist in generating semantic declarations
in addition to a lightweight infrastructure for this purpose we discuss tools
tools that may address some interesting issues in query processing and optimization
tools that may assist in generating formulation of global queries
