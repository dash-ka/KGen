we describe a tool for reasoning with the darpa agent markup language
we describe performing inference on the semantic web
we describe damljesskb
damljesskb maps semantics from the darpa agent markup language into facts for use in a production system such as the java expert system she will  jess 
damljesskb maps semantics from the darpa agent markup language into rules for use in a production system such as the java expert system she will  jess 
this article presents our underlying methodology
this article provides a detailed example of how damljesskb can be used to make decisions about damlencoded engineering design knowledge
we believe that tools like damljesskb are needed to help realize the full potential of the semantic web
