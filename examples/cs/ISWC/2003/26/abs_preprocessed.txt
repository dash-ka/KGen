Policies are controlling the behavior of complex systems
Policies are being increasingly used for automated system management
the components being governed
The use of policies allows administrators to modify system behavior without requiring the consent or cooperation of the components
The use of policies allows administrators to modify system behavior without changing source code
Early approaches to policy representation have been restrictive in many ways
However semanticallyrich policy representations can reduce human error simplify policy analysis facilitate interoperability
However semanticallyrich policy representations can reduce human error simplify policy analysis reduce policy conflicts
In this paper we compare three approaches to enforcement
In this paper we compare three approaches to reasoning
In this paper we compare three approaches to policy representation
