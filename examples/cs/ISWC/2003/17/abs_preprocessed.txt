Easy integration of available tools will be a key success factor for the future of the Semantic Web
We envision that semantic descriptions of the tools the tools themselves will play an important part in addressing this issue
Motivated by this vision We used a key initiative to support automated management of Web services  to describe query engine 
Motivated by this vision We used a key initiative to support automated management of Web services  to describe Sesame 
Motivated by this vision We used DAMLS  to describe query engine 
Motivated by this vision We used DAMLS  to describe an RDF  S  storage

This paper discusses the major problems that We encountered as well as suggested solutions
This work is relevant to other the Semantic Web research groups
the Semantic Web research groups who wish to annotate other Semantic Web research groups tools
the Semantic Web research groups who wish to use annotated tools
Also We hope to offer helpful input to the DAMLS coalition in the further development of other Semantic Web research groups standard
