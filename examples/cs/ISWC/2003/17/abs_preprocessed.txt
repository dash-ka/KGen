this paper discusses the major problems that we encountered as well as suggested solutions
the semantic web research groups who wish to use annotated tools
this work is relevant to other the semantic web research groups
the semantic web research groups who wish to annotate other semantic web research groups tools
also we hope to offer helpful input to the damls coalition in the further development of other semantic web research groups standard
