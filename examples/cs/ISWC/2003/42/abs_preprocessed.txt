in the  traditional approach  to ontology engineering experts add new data by carefully analyzing others ontologies into the existing hierarchy

scratch that addresses ordinary users immediate needs without worrying if ordinary users data may some day integrate with others data
in the ordinary users may not look at anyones ontology before creating theirs instead ordinary users may simply define a new local schema from scratch

the emerging  semantic web approach 
this paper describes webscripter 
this paper describes a tool for translating between the countless miniontologies that the  semantic web approach  yields
in our approach ordinary users graphically align data from multiple sources in a simple spreadsheetlike view without having to know anything about ontologies
the resulting web of equivalency statements is then mined by webscripter to help users find related ontologies and data
the resulting web of equivalency statements is then mined by webscripter to automatically align the related data with users own
