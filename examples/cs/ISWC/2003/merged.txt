we will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches
we will also compare this approach with the existing rdf model theorywe develop a semantics based approach to process information on the semantic web
markup languages designed for describing resources on the semantic web  such as rdf 
we show how horn logic can be used to denotationally capture the semantics of markup languages
the same approach can also be used to specify the semantics of query languages for the semantic web
when put together can be used to compute answers to semantic web queries
these executable semantics are executable
the main advantage of this semanticbased approach to processing the semantic web is that these executable semantics can be developed extremely quickly
thus as the semantic web markup languages evolve rapidly the semantic web markup languages implementations can be developed at the same pace
in this paper we present we approach based on denotational semantics

web services would greatly simplify the development of many kinds of data integration
web services would greatly simplify the development of many kinds of knowledge management applications
unfortunately this vision requires that services describe services with large amounts of semantic metadata  glue 
we explore a variety of machine learning techniques to semiautomatically create such metadatahtml documents that are designed primarily for human consumption
html documents that are not directly amenable to machine processing
although rdfxml has been widely recognized as the standard vehicle for representing semantic information on the web an enormous amount of semantic data is still being encoded in html documents
this paper seeks to bridge this semantic gap by addressing the fundamental problem of automatically annotating html documents with semantic labels
exploiting a key observation that semantically related items exhibit consistency in presentation style we have developed a novel framework for automatically partitioning such documents into semantic structures

unfortunately these efforts leave us a long way from seamless interoperation
researchers in the semantic web community have taken up this challenge proposing topdown approaches to achieve aspects of web service interoperation
unfortunately many of these efforts have been disconnected from emerging industry standards particularly in process modeling
in this paper we take a bottomup approach to integrating semantic web technology into web services
building on bpel4ws we present integrated semantic web technology for automating customized dynamic binding of web services together with interoperation through semantic translation
we discuss the value of semantically enriched service interoperation
we demonstrate how we framework accounts for userdefined constraints while gaining potentially successful execution pathways in a practically motivated example
finally we provide an analysis of the forwardlooking limitations of frameworks like bpel4ws
finally we suggest how such specifications might embrace semantic technology at a fundamental level to work towards fully automated web service interoperationissues that surround the provision of application support

by a distributed manner we mean ontology is divided into several component ontologies
several component ontologies which are developed by different developers in a distributed environment
the target ontology is obtained by compiling the component ontologies
the component ontologies are identified according to the component ontologies conceptual level
the component ontologies are identified according to the component ontologies domain characteristics
the distributed development of ontologies applies to many situations such as cooperative development reusing ontologies and so on
to support such a way of ontology development we investigate the dependency between component ontologies
to support such a way of ontology development we design some functions for management of component ontologies based on component ontologies dependencies
we next design a function to suggest a few candidate modifications of the target ontology for keeping the consistency
we next consider the influence of a change of one ontology to others through one ontology to others dependencies
we also present some examples of how the system worksa way that is consistent with ontologies
