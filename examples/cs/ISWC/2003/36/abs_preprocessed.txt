the aim is to provide more versatile access to other multimedia representations
the aim is to provide more versatile access to 2d images
the aim is to provide more versatile access to 3d models
the aim is to provide more versatile access to digital collections
an ontology for the museum domain based on the cidoc conceptual reference model is being developed as a semantic layer with references to the digital collection as instance information
conventional content based searching
a graphical concept browser is an integral component in the user interface allowing navigation through the semantic layer display of thumbnails or the invocation of conventional content or combined querying
a graphical concept browser is an integral component in the user interface allowing navigation through the semantic layer display of thumbnails or textual information in appropriate viewers or combined querying
a graphical concept browser is an integral component in the user interface allowing navigation through the semantic layer display of thumbnails or full representations of artefacts or combined querying
