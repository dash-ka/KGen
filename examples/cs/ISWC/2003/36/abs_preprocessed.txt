the aim is to provide more versatile access to 2D images
An ontology for the museum domain based on the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model is being developed as a semantic layer with references to the digital collection as instance information
A graphical concept browser is an integral component in the user interface allowing navigation through the semantic layer display of thumbnails or full representations of artefacts or combined querying
A graphical concept browser is an integral component in the user interface allowing navigation through the semantic layer display of thumbnails or the invocation of conventional content or combined querying
