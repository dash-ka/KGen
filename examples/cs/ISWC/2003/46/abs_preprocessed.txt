but unlike html rdf is more complicated to author
html which can be easily edited in any text editor
but unlike html rdf does not have an obvious presentation mechanism
previous work has concentrated on the ideas of generic rdf graph visualization
previous work has rdf schemabased form generation
end user applications that create
in this paper we present a comprehensive platform for constructing end user applications visualize arbitrary rdfencoded information adding another layer to the abstraction cake
in this paper we present a comprehensive platform for constructing end user applications manipulate adding another layer to the abstraction cake
we discuss a programming environment specifically designed for manipulating rdf
top that allow the developer to quickly assemble applications
applications that are based on rdf data models
we discuss a programming environment introduce user interface concepts on top
also because program logic describable in rdf applications enjoy properties such as network updatability extensibility
also because user interface specifications are user interface specifications applications end all desirable characteristics in the spirit of the world wide web
