An important issue is to know whether Web ontology languages meet the expected requirements of expressiveness

This paper aims at contributing to this question in comparing several languages

After describing the needs of a Semantic Web in This paper analyses Protege primitives on a concrete medical ontology the brain cortex anatomy ontology
After describing the needs of a Semantic Web in medicine on a concrete medical ontology the brain cortex anatomy ontology
After describing the needs of a Semantic Web in This paper analyses DAMLOIL primitives on a concrete medical ontology the brain cortex anatomy ontology
This paper draws conclusions about the requirements that a Web ontology language should meet for the representation of medical taxonomy and axioms
The expressiveness of OWL DL seems suited to describe the complex taxonomic knowledge
The expressiveness of DAMLOIL DL seems suited to describe the complex taxonomic knowledge
But rules are required for representing dependencies between relations 
But rules are required for to support several tasks 
But rules are required for representing the deductive knowledge 
But rules are required for to support ontology construction maintenance verification query of heterogeneous distributed information sources 
Finally This paper evaluates the of an hybrid language CARINALNwith respect to these requirements
Finally This paper evaluates the features of the next standard OWL CARINALNwith respect to these requirements
