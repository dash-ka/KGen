html documents that are designed primarily for human consumption
html documents that are not directly amenable to machine processing
although rdfxml has been widely recognized as the standard vehicle for representing semantic information on the web an enormous amount of semantic data is still being encoded in html documents
this paper seeks to bridge this semantic gap by addressing the fundamental problem of automatically annotating html documents with semantic labels
exploiting a key observation that semantically related items exhibit consistency in presentation style we have developed a novel framework for automatically partitioning such documents into semantic structures
exploiting a key observation that semantically related items exhibit spatial locality in templatebased contentrich html documents we have developed a novel framework for automatically partitioning such documents into semantic structures
semantic analysis incorporating lexical databases such as wordnet
we framework tightly couples structural analysis of documents with semantic analysis
semantic analysis incorporating domain ontologies
we present experimental evidence of the effectiveness of we techniques on a large collection of html documents from various news portals
