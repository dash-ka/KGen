increasingly application developers are looking for ways to provide users with higher levels of personalization
personalization that capture different elements of a users operating context such as the task that her is currently engaged in who her colleagues are while there are many sources of contextual information her colleagues tend to vary from one user over time

different location tracking functionality provided by different cell phone operators
a semantic ewallet aimed at supporting each represented as a semantic web service
different users may rely on different location tracking functionality different users may use different calendar systems in this paper we describe work on a semantic ewallet
a semantic ewallet aimed at supporting automated discovery and access of personal resources
a key objective is to provide a semantic web environment for open access to a users contextual resources thereby reducing the costs
the costs associated with the development and maintenance of contextaware applications
a second objective is through semantic web technologies to empower users to selectively control who has access to under which conditions
