a Semantic eWallet aimed at supporting automated discovery and access of personal resources
Different users may rely on different location tracking functionality Different users may use different calendar systems In this paper we describe work on a Semantic eWallet
different location tracking functionality provided by different cell phone operators

the costs associated with the development and maintenance of contextaware applications
A key objective is to provide a Semantic Web environment for open access to a users contextual resources thereby reducing the costs
A second objective is through Semantic Web technologies to empower users to selectively control who has access to users contextual information conditions
