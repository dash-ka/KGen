in this paper we describe magpie
a tool which supports the interpretation of web pages
in this paper we describe a tool
complementary knowledge sources which a reader can call upon to quickly gain access to any background knowledge relevant to a web resource
a tool which supports the interpretation of web pages
a tool offers complementary knowledge sources
magpie offers complementary knowledge sources
a tool which supports the interpretation of web pages
a tool automatically associates an ontologybased semantic layer to web resources allowing relevant services to be invoked within a standard web browser
magpie automatically associates an ontologybased semantic layer to web resources allowing relevant services to be invoked within a standard web browser
hence a tool may be seen as a step towards a semantic web browser
a tool which supports the interpretation of web pages
hence magpie may be seen as a step towards a semantic web browser
the functionality of magpie is illustrated using examples of how the functionality of magpie has been integrated with our labs web resources
