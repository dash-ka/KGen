Assuming P  GI  NP the creation and verification of a digital signature of an arbitrary RDF graph can not be done in polynomial time
However it is possible to define a large class of canonicalizable RDF graphs such that digital signatures for graphs in this class can be verified in O 
However it is possible to define a large class of canonicalizable RDF graphs such that digital signatures for graphs in this class can be created in O 
However it is possible to define a large class of canonicalizable RDF graphs such that digital signatures for graphs in this class can be created in nlog 
However it is possible to define a large class of canonicalizable RDF graphs such that digital signatures for graphs in this class can be verified in nlog 
Without changing this class meaning an arbitrary RDF graph can be nondeterministically precanonicalized into a graph of this class before signing
The techniques in this paper are key enablers for the use of digital signature technology in the Semantic Web
