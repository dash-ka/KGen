a firenew infrastructure promises to support an automatic informationprocessing platform for multiagent system whose ultimate objective is to provide better services for endusers for example interoperable information query
a firenew infrastructure promises to support an intelligent informationprocessing platform for multiagent system whose ultimate objective is to provide better services for endusers for example interoperable information query
semantic web supports a firenew infrastructure for solving the problem of semantic information interoperability
therefore except agenttoagent interaction in multiagent system there is humantoagent interaction
to unify the two kinds of interaction this paper introduces q language a scenario description language for designing interaction among users
to unify the two kinds of interaction this paper introduces q language a scenario description language for designing interaction among agents
a qbased architecture which integrates multiagent query system
a qbased architecture which integrates ontologymapping servers
a qbased architecture which integrates ontology servers
a qbased architecture is presented as a system solution to semantic information interoperability on semantic web
a qbased architecture which integrates semantic information sources
furthermore we investigate domain ontology ontologymapping service
furthermore we give an implementation to demonstrate how our architecture works
furthermore we investigate key technologies of interoperability
furthermore we investigate related multiagent system
