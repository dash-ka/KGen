along with developing specifications for the description of metadata it is important to maximize security in this environment
this environment which is fundamentally open of many of the clues human societies have relied on for security assessment
this environment which is fundamentally dynamic of many of the clues human societies have relied on for security assessment
this environment which is fundamentally devoid of many of the clues human societies have relied on for security assessment
along with developing specifications for the extraction of information for the semantic web it is important to maximize security in this environment
our research investigates the
the marking up of web entities with the use of distributed policy management as an alternative to traditional authentication
the marking up of web entities with a semantic policy language
the marking up of web entities with the use of distributed policy management as an alternative to access control schemes
the policy language allows policies to be described in terms of deontic concepts acts which allows the dynamic modification of existing policies
the policy language allows policies to be described in terms of models speech acts which allows the dynamic modification of existing policies
the policy language allows policies to be described in terms of deontic concepts acts which allows decentralized security control
the policy language allows policies to be described in terms of deontic concepts acts which allows less exhaustive policies
the policy language allows policies to be described in terms of models speech acts which allows less exhaustive policies
the policy language allows policies to be described in terms of models speech acts which allows decentralized security control
a security framework based on this policy language
we present a security framework which addresses security issues for web resources agents and services in the semantic web
