Along with developing specifications for the description of metadata it is important to maximize security in this environment

Along with developing specifications for the extraction of information for the Semantic Web it is important to maximize security in this environment
the marking up of web entities with the use of distributed policy management as an alternative to traditional authentication
the marking up of web entities with the use of distributed policy management as an alternative to access control schemes
Our research investigates the
the marking up of web entities with a semantic policy language
The policy language allows policies to be described in terms of deontic concepts acts which allows the dynamic modification of existing policies
The policy language allows policies to be described in terms of models speech acts which allows decentralized security control
The policy language allows policies to be described in terms of models speech acts which allows the dynamic modification of existing policies
The policy language allows policies to be described in terms of deontic concepts acts which allows decentralized security control
The policy language allows policies to be described in terms of deontic concepts acts which allows less exhaustive policies
The policy language allows policies to be described in terms of models speech acts which allows less exhaustive policies
We present a security framework which addresses security issues for web resources agents and services in the Semantic Web
a security framework based on this policy language
