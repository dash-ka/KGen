Unfortunately these efforts leave us a long way from seamless interoperation
Researchers in the Semantic Web community have taken up this challenge proposing topdown approaches to achieve aspects of Web Service interoperation
Unfortunately many of these efforts have been disconnected from emerging industry standards particularly in process modeling
In this paper we take a bottomup approach to integrating Semantic Web technology into Web services
Building on BPEL4WS we present integrated Semantic Web technology for automating customized dynamic binding of Web services together with interoperation through semantic translation
we demonstrate how we framework accounts for userdefined constraints while gaining potentially successful execution pathways in a practically motivated example
we discuss the value of semantically enriched service interoperation
Finally we suggest how such specifications might embrace semantic technology at a fundamental level to work towards fully automated Web service interoperation
Finally we provide an analysis of the forwardlooking limitations of frameworks like BPEL4WS
