The success of the Semantic Web hinges on being able to produce semantic markups on Web pages in a way
a way that is costeffective with ontologies
a way that is costeffective with adopted schemas
The success of the Semantic Web hinges on being able to produce semantic markups on semantic markups components in a way
a way that is consistent with adopted schemas
a way that is consistent with ontologies
Since images are an essential component of the Semantic Web this work focuses on an intelligent approach to semantic annotation of images
a threelayer architecture in which the bottom layer organizes visual information
the middle layer which are then connected to ontologies on the top layer
the middle layer which are then connected to schemas on the top layer
We propose a threelayer architecture
the raw image contents which are mapped to semantically meaningful keywords in the middle layer
visual information extracted from the raw image contents
We key contribution is the use of machine learning algorithms for userassisted semiautomatic image annotation in such a way that the knowledge of previously annotated images both visual levels is used to speed up the annotation of subsequent images within the same domain
We key contribution is the use of machine learning algorithms for userassisted semiautomatic image annotation in such a way that the knowledge of previously annotated images both at metadata is used to improve future query and retrieval of annotated images
