a way that is consistent with ontologies
the success of the semantic web hinges on being able to produce semantic markups on web pages in a way
a way that is costeffective with ontologies
the success of the semantic web hinges on being able to produce semantic markups on semantic markups components in a way
a way that is consistent with adopted schemas
a way that is costeffective with adopted schemas
since images are an essential component of the semantic web this work focuses on an intelligent approach to semantic annotation of images
the middle layer which are then connected to ontologies on the top layer
the middle layer which are then connected to schemas on the top layer
visual information extracted from the raw image contents
a threelayer architecture in which the bottom layer organizes visual information
we propose a threelayer architecture
the raw image contents which are mapped to semantically meaningful keywords in the middle layer
we key contribution is the use of machine learning algorithms for userassisted semiautomatic image annotation in such a way that the knowledge of previously annotated images both visual levels is used to improve future query and retrieval of annotated images
