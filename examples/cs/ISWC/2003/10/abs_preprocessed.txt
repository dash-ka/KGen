ontologies are shared models of a domain
a domain that encode a view
a view which is common to a set of different parties
contexts are local models
local models that encode a partys subjective view of a domain
in this paper we show how ontologies can be contextualized thus acquiring certain useful properties that a pure shared approach can not provide
a contextual ontology when an ontology contents are kept local
a contextual ontology when an ontology contents are not shared with other ontologies
a contextual ontology when an ontology contents are mapped with the contents of other ontologies via explicit  mappings
a contextual ontology when an ontology contents are mapped with the contents of other ontologies via context  mappings
we say that an ontology is  also that it is a contextual ontology
we say that an ontology is contextualized
a language whose syntax have been obtained by extending the owl syntax and semantics to allow for the representation of contextual ontologies
