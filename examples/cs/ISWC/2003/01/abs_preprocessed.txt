We show how to reduce OWL Lite ontology languages to knowledge base satisfiability in  respectively  SHIF 
first establishing a correspondence between description logic knowledge bases
This is done then by showing how knowledge base entailment can be reduced to knowledge base satisfiability
first establishing a correspondence between OWL ontologies
This is done by first
