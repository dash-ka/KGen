Resources on the Semantic Web are described by metadata based on some informal ontology
Resources on the Semantic Web are described by metadata based on some formal ontology
It is a common situation that casual users are not familiar with a domain ontology in detail
This makes This difficult for or This user tools  to formulate queries to find the relevant resources
This makes This difficult for such users  to formulate queries to find the relevant resources
Users consider the resources in Users specific context so the most straightforward solution is to formulate queries in an ontology
an ontology that corresponds to a userspecific view
We present an approach based on multiple views
multiple views expressed in ontologies simpler than the domain ontology
This allows users to query heterogeneous data repositories in terms of multiple relatively simple view ontologies
Ontology developers can define such view ontologies
Ontology developers can define the corresponding mapping rules
multiple relatively simple view ontologies are represented in the Semantic Web ontology languages such as DAMLOIL
multiple relatively simple view ontologies are represented in the Semantic Web ontology languages such as OWL
multiple relatively simple view ontologies are represented in the Semantic Web ontology languages such as RDFS
We present We approach with examples from the elearning domain
the elearning domain using the the Semantic Web query and transformation language TRIPLE
