In the next generation of the Internet semantic annotations will enable software agents to extract
In the next generation of the Internet semantic annotations will interpret web content more quickly than this paper is possible with current techniques
The focus of this paper is to develop security annotations for web services
web services that are represented in DAMLS
web services that are used by agents
We propose several securityrelated ontologies
several securityrelated ontologies that are designed to represent wellknown security concepts
several securityrelated ontologies are used to describe the security requirements and capabilities of web services providers
several securityrelated ontologies that are designed to represent wellknown security concepts
several securityrelated ontologies are requesting agents
A reasoning engine decides whether web service have comparable security characteristics
A reasoning engine decides whether agents have comparable security characteristics
We prototypical implementation uses the Java Theorem Prover from Stanford for deciding the degree to which the requirements and capabilities match based on our matching algorithm
The security reasoner is integrated with the Semantic Matchmaker from CMU giving The security reasoner the ability to provide security
security brokering between agents
