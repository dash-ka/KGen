The Grid is an emerging technology for enabling resource sharing
problem solving in dynamic multiinstitutional virtual organizations
The Grid is an emerging technology for coordinated problem
In the Grid environment shared resources typically span different organizations
In the Grid environment users typically span different organizations
The resource matching problem in The Grid involves assigning resources to tasks in order to satisfy resource policies
The resource matching problem in The Grid involves assigning resources to tasks in order to satisfy task requirements
task requirements are often expressed in disjoint application forcing a resource selector to perform semantic matching between the two
resource policies are often expressed in disjoint application forcing a resource selector to perform semantic matching between the two
resource policies are often expressed in resource models forcing a resource selector to perform semantic matching between the two
task requirements are often expressed in resource models forcing a resource selector to perform semantic matching between the two
The Grid using semantic web technologies
In this paper we propose a flexible approach for solving resource matching in The Grid
In this paper we propose a extensible approach for solving resource matching in The Grid
We have designed
an ontologybased resource selector that exploits background knowledge for solving resource matching in The Grid
an ontologybased resource selector that exploits ontologies for solving resource matching in The Grid
an ontologybased resource selector that exploits rules for solving resource matching in The Grid
We prototyped an ontologybased resource selector
