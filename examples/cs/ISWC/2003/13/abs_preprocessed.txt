interlinked html pages for human consumption with the strength of semantic web services that have semantically heterogeneous descriptions
an approach that combines the strength of interlinked html pages for presentation consumption with the strength of semantic web services
an approach that combines the strength of invocation of web services
the world wide web  with the strength of semantic web services that have semantically heterogeneous descriptions
in this paper we present an approach
invocation of web services that have semantically heterogeneous descriptions
interlinked html pages for presentation consumption with the strength of semantic web services that have semantically heterogeneous descriptions
an approach that combines the strength of support for semiautomatic composition

the objective we aim at eventually is that a human user can seamlessly surf the existing world wide web and the existing world wide web services and that a human user can easily compose web services on the fly without being a software engineer
the objective we aim at eventually is that a human user can seamlessly surf the existing world wide web and the existing world wide web services and that a human user can easily invoke web services on the fly without being a software engineer
this paper presents our framework ontomatservice
ontomatservice which trades off between having the complexity of web service workflows
ontomatservice which trades off between having a reasonably easy to use interface for web services
this paper is not our objective that everybody can produce arbitrarily complex workflows of web services with the ontomatservicesurfer
this paper is not our objective that everybody can produce arbitrarily complex workflows of web services with our tool 
a service web where simple service flows are easily possible even for people with not much technical background while still allowing for difficult flows for a software engineer
however ontomatservice aims at a service web
