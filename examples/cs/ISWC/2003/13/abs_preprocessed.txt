The objective we aim at eventually is that a human user can seamlessly surf the existing World Wide Web and the existing World Wide Web services and that a human user can easily compose Web services on the fly without being a software engineer

OntoMatService which trades off between having the complexity of web service workflows
this paper presents our framework OntoMatService
OntoMatService which trades off between having a reasonably easy to use interface for web services
this paper is not our objective that everybody can produce arbitrarily complex workflows of web services with our tool 
this paper is not our objective that everybody can produce arbitrarily complex workflows of web services with the OntoMatServiceSurfer
However OntoMatService aims at a service web
a service web where simple service flows are easily possible even for people with not much technical background while still allowing for difficult flows for a software engineer
