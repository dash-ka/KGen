We develop a semantics based approach to process information on the semantic web
We show how Horn logic can be used to denotationally capture the semantics of markup languages
markup languages designed for describing resources on the semantic web  such as RDF 
The same approach can also be used to specify the semantics of query languages for the semantic web
when put together can be used to compute answers to semantic web queries
these executable semantics are executable
The main advantage of this semanticbased approach to processing the semantic web is that these executable semantics can be developed extremely quickly
Thus as the semantic web markup languages evolve rapidly the semantic web markup languages implementations can be developed at the same pace
In this paper we present we approach based on Horn logic

we approach is quite general though in this paper we illustrate this paper via RDF
