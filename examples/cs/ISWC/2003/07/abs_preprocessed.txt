when web applications return answers many users do not know what information was looked up
when web applications return answers many users do not know what information was derived
when web applications return answers many users do not know what information sources were used
when web applications return answers many users do not know when many users were updated
updated how reliable the source was
reasoning paths used to derive answers
the inference web rrb also lacks support for explaining reasoning paths
the inference web rrb also lacks support for explaining reasoning paths
the inference web aims to make the answers more transparent by providing explanations
the inference web aims to take opaque query answers
the explanations include information concerning how answers were derived  or retrieved 
the explanations include information concerning where answers came from  or retrieved 
in this paper we describe an infrastructure for the inference web explanations
an extensible webbased registry containing details on information sources reasoners languages
an infrastructure for the inference web explanations includes an extensible webbased registry
an infrastructure for the inference web explanations rewrite a portable proof specification
an infrastructure for the inference web explanations rewrite rules
an infrastructure for the inference web explanations rewrite a explanation browser
an infrastructure for the inference web explanations rewrite a proof browser
source information in the the the inference web registry is used to convey knowledge provenance

the inference web lrb the inference web rrb is in use by two semantic web agents fully registered in the the inference web
two semantic web agents using an embedded reasoning engine
additional reasoning engine registration is underway in order to help provide input for evaluation of the adequacy breadth and scalability of our approach
