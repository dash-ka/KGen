topic maps are a standardized modelling approach for the semantic annotation and description of www resources
topic maps enable an improved search on information objects
information objects stored in semistructured information spaces like the www
topic maps enable navigational access on information objects
however the according standards iso 13250 lack formal semantics several questions concerning eg subclassing inheritance are left open

topic maps which enables semantic constraints to be formulated in object constraint language  in order to answer such open questions
topic maps which enables semantic constraints to be formulated in ocl  in order to answer such open questions
topic maps which enables semantic constraints to be formulated in object constraint language  in order to overcome possible inconsistencies in topic map repositories
the proposed tmuml meta model directly derived from the well known uml meta model is a meta model for topic maps
topic maps which enables semantic constraints to be formulated in ocl  in order to overcome possible inconsistencies in topic map repositories
several examples how the proposed tmuml meta model directly derived from the well known uml meta model enables semantic constraints for topic map
topic map merging to be formulated in ocl
we will examine show in several examples
we will examine the xtm merging conditions in several examples
finally we will show how checking if a topic map is well formed includes we merging conditions
finally we will show how the tm validation process includes we merging conditions
