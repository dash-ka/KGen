In this paper we present a new approach the datatype group approach to integrating DLs with multiple datatypes
we discuss the advantages of such approach over the existing ones
we show how a tableaux algorithm for the description logic SHOQ  can be modified in order to reason with datatype groups
we show how a tableaux algorithm for D n  can be modified in order to reason with datatype groups
