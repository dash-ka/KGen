the damls process model is designed to support the application of ai planning techniques to the automated composition of web services
shop2 is an hierarchical task network  htn  planner wellsuited for working with the process model
we have proven the correspondence between the semantics of shop2 process model
we have proven the correspondence between the situation calculus semantics of the process model
we have also implemented a system
a system which soundly plans over sets of damls descriptions
a system which executes the resulting plans over the web
sets of damls descriptions using a shop2 planner
a system which completely plans over sets of damls descriptions
we discuss the challenges and difficulties of using shop2 in the informationrich context of web services
we discuss the challenges and difficulties of using shop2 in the humanoriented context of web services
