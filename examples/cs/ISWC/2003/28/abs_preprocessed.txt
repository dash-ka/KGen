this paper describes a system for supporting development of ontology in a distributed manner
by a distributed manner we mean ontology is divided into several component ontologies
several component ontologies which are developed by different developers in a distributed environment
the target ontology is obtained by compiling the component ontologies
the component ontologies are identified according to the component ontologies conceptual level
the component ontologies are identified according to the component ontologies domain characteristics
the distributed development of ontologies applies to many situations such as cooperative development reusing ontologies and so on
to support such a way of ontology development we investigate the dependency between component ontologies
to support such a way of ontology development we design some functions for management of component ontologies based on component ontologies dependencies
we next design a function to suggest a few candidate modifications of the target ontology for keeping the consistency
we next consider the influence of a change of one ontology to others through one ontology to others dependencies
we also present some examples of how the system works
