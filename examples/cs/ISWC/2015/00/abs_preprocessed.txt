The original SPARQL proposal was often criticized for The original SPARQL proposal inability to navigate through RDF
For this reason property paths were introduced in SPARQL 11
no theoretical studies examining how property paths addition to the language affects main computational tasks such as query containment
no theoretical studies examining how property paths addition to the language affects main computational tasks such as query evaluation
up to date there are no theoretical studies
no theoretical studies examining how property paths addition to the language affects main computational tasks such as query subsumption
In this paper we show that although the addition of property paths has no impact on query evaluation property paths do make the containment problems substantially more difficult
In this paper we tackle all of these problems
