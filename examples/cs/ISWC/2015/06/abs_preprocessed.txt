clientside query processing techniques provide a promising solution for web query processing
clientside query processing techniques that rely on the materialization of fragments of the original rdf dataset
because of unexpected data transfers the traditional optimizethenexecute paradigm is not always applicable in this context
the traditional optimizethenexecute paradigm used by existing approaches
performance of clientside execution plans can be negatively affected by live conditions where rate at which data arrive from sources changes
however
linked data eddies that is able to adjust query execution schedulers to data availability
we present a network of linked data eddies
we tackle adaptivity for clientside query processing
linked data eddies that is runtime conditions
experimental studies suggest that the network of linked data eddies outperforms static web query schedulers in scenarios with data distributions
experimental studies suggest that the network of linked data eddies outperforms static web query schedulers in scenarios with unpredictable transfer delays
