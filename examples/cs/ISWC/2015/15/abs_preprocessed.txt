data integration proposed by Noy
analysis tools that select the best mapping
The iterative user interaction approach for data integration can be generalized to consider interactions between integration tools
data integration proposed by Falconer
integration tools that generate analysis tools
integration tools that generate potential schema mappings and users
Each such selection then provides highconfidence guidance for the next iteration of the integration tool
this generalized instance alignments between heterogeneous data
this generalized approach in CogMap
this generalized a matching system for both property
We have implemented this
The interactions between integration tool in CogMap presents The interactions between integration tool in CogMap consequences to the potential schema mappings and users
The interactions between integration tool in CogMap uses the instance alignment from the previous iteration to create highquality property alignments
The interactions between integration tool in CogMap presents The interactions between integration tool in CogMap consequences to analysis tool
The interactions between integration tool in CogMap presents highquality property alignments to analysis tool
The interactions between integration tool in CogMap presents highquality property alignments to the potential schema mappings and users
We experiments show that the interplay between instance alignment serve to improve the final alignments
We experiments show that the interplay between property alignment serve to improve the final alignments
We experiments show that multiple iterations serve to improve the final alignments
