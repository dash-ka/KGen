in this paper we propose a general purpose recursion operator to develop algorithms for evaluating sparql in practical scenarios
in this paper we propose a general purpose recursion operator to be added to sparql
in this paper we propose a general purpose recursion operator to formalize sparql syntax
we also show how to implement recursion as a plugin on top of existing systems
we also show how to test a plugin performance on several real world datasets
