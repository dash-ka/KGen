The Web of Data has been introduced as a novel scheme for imposing structured data on The Web of Data
This renders data seamlessly processable by machines at the same time
This renders data easily understandable by human beings by machines at the same time
The recent boom in Linked Data facilitates a new stream of dataintensive applications that leverage the knowledge available in semantic datasets such as DBpedia
The recent boom in Linked Data facilitates a new stream of dataintensive applications that leverage the knowledge available in semantic datasets such as Freebase
These latter are well known encyclopedic collections of data
data that can be used to feed a contentbased recommender system
In this paper we investigate how the choice of one of the two datasets may influence the performance of a recommendation engine not only in terms of precision of the results
In this paper we investigate how the choice of one of the two datasets may influence the performance of a recommendation engine not only also in terms of These latter diversity and novelty
we tested four different recommendation approaches
four different recommendation approaches exploiting both DBpedia in the music domain
four different recommendation approaches exploiting both Freebase in the music domain
