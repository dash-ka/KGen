the dynamic nature of web data gives rise to a multitude of problems the curators of biological information where changes are interrelated
the dynamic nature of web data gives rise to a multitude of problems the curators of biological information where changes are constant
a framework that enables identifying understanding these dynamics
in this paper we propose a framework
a framework that enables identifying analysing these dynamics
we approach is flexible enough to capture the peculiarities and needs of different applications on dynamic data while being formally robust due to the satisfaction of the completeness properties
we approach is flexible enough to capture the peculiarities and needs of different applications on dynamic data while being formally robust due to the satisfaction of the unambiguity properties
queries involving both changes
a manner that enables easy navigation among versions queries
in addition we framework allows the persistent representation of the detected changes between versions in a manner
a manner that enables efficient navigation among versions automated processing and analysis of changes crosssnapshot queries  spanning across different versions
