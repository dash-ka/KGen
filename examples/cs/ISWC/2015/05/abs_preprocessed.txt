triple pattern fragments which allows clients to execute sparql queries against lowcost servers at the cost of higher bandwidth
one of these interfaces is triple pattern fragments
requests which can among others be achieved through additional metadata in responses
increasing a clients efficiency means lowering the number of requests
we noted that typical sparql query evaluations against triple pattern fragments require a significant portion of membership subqueries
we noted that typical sparql query evaluations against triple pattern fragments require a variable pattern
membership subqueries which check the presence of a specific triple
one of these interfaces studies bloom filters as extra metadata
one of these interfaces studies the impact of providing approximate membership functions as extra metadata
one of these interfaces studies golombcoded sets as extra metadata
in addition to reducing http requests such functions allow to achieve full result recall earlier when temporarily allowing lower precision
half of the tested queries from a watdiv benchmark test set could be executed with up to a third fewer http requests with only marginally higher server cost
query times however did not improve likely due to slower metadata generation and transfer
this indicates that approximate membership functions can partly improve the clientside query process with minimal impact on the server
