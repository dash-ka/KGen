NoHR allows the user to query the combined knowledge base
NoHR allows the user to express exceptions
NoHR allows the user to combine an OWL 2 EL ontology with a set of nonmonotonic  rules suitable
NoHR allows the user to combine an OWL 2 EL ontology with a set of logic programming  rules suitable
NoHR allows the user to express defaults
The formal approach realized in NoHR is polynomial 
The formal approach realized in NoHR is wrt data complexity 
The formal approach realized in NoHR has been shown that even very large health care ontologies such as SNOMED CT can be handled
As each of the tractable OWL profiles is motivated by different application cases extending the tool to the other profiles is of particular interest also because the other profiles preserve the polynomial data complexity of the combined formalism
Yet a straightforward adaptation of the existing approach to OWL 2 QL turns out to not be viable
In this paper we provide the nontrivial solution for the extension of NoHR to OWL 2 QL by directly translating the ontology into rules without any prior classification
we evaluation shows encouraging results
we have implemented we approach
