We introduce optimization techniques for reasoning in DLN a recently introduced family of nonmonotonic description logics whose characterizing features appear wellsuited to model the examples naturally arising in biomedical domains
We introduce optimization techniques for reasoning in DLN a recently introduced family of nonmonotonic description logics whose characterizing features appear wellsuited to model the examples naturally arising in semantic web access control policies
Such optimizations are validated experimentally on large KBs with more than 30K axioms
Speedups exceed 1 order of magnitude
For the first time response times compatible with realtime reasoning are obtained with nonmonotonic KBs of this size
