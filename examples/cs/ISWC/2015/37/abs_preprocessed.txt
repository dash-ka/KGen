making available is for the most part still considered the task of classical publishing companies despite the fact that classical forms of publishing centered around printed narrative articles no longer seem wellsuited in the digital age
archiving scientific results is for the most part still considered the task of classical publishing companies despite the fact that classical forms of publishing centered around printed narrative articles no longer seem wellsuited in the digital age
in particular there exist currently agreedupon methods for publishing scientific datasets
in particular there exist currently no efficient reliable for publishing scientific datasets
publishing scientific datasets which have become increasingly important for science
here we propose to design scientific data publishing as a webbased bottomup process without topdown control of central authorities such as publishing companies
based on a novel combination of technologies we present a server network to decentrally store and archive data in the form of an rdfbased format to represent scientific data
based on a novel combination of technologies we present a server network to decentrally store and archive data in the form of nanopublications to represent scientific data
based on a novel combination of existing concepts we present a server network to decentrally store and archive data in the form of nanopublications to represent scientific data
based on a novel combination of existing concepts we present a server network to decentrally store and archive data in the form of an rdfbased format to represent scientific data
we show how this approach allows researchers to publish retrieve verify and recombine datasets of nanopublications in a trustworthy manner
we argue that this architecture could be used for the semantic web in general
we show how this approach allows researchers to publish retrieve verify and recombine datasets of nanopublications in a reliable manner
evaluation of the current small network shows that this system is efficient
evaluation of the current small network shows that this system is reliable
