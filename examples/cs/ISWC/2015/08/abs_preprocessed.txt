The key challenge for visualizing Linked Data consists in supporting nontechnical users in finding suitable visualizations while hiding technical details of Linked Data
The key challenge for visualizing Linked Data consists in providing a clear overview of Linked Data
The key challenge for visualizing Linked Data consists in supporting nontechnical users in finding suitable visualizations while hiding technical details of visualization configuration
In order to accomplish this we propose a largely automatic workflow which guides users through the process of creating visualizations by automatically categorizing
In order to accomplish this we propose a largely automatic workflow which guides users through binding data to visualization parameters
The approach is based on a heuristic analysis of the structure of the input data
a comprehensive visualization model facilitating the automatic binding between data
a comprehensive visualization model facilitating the automatic binding between visualization parameters
The approach is based on a comprehensive visualization model
The resulting assignments are presented to the user
The resulting assignments are ranked to the user
With LinkDaViz we provide a webbased implementation of the approach
With LinkDaViz we demonstrate the feasibility by performance evaluation
With LinkDaViz we demonstrate the feasibility by an extended user
