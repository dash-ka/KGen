algebras of relations were shown useful in managing ontology alignments
algebras of relations make it possible to aggregate alignments conjunctively
algebras of relations make it possible to aggregate alignments disjunctively
to propagate alignments within a network of ontologies
the previously considered algebra of relations
the previously contains taxonomical relations between classes
however compositional inference is sound only if we assume that classes have nonempty extensions
compositional inference using this algebra
classes which occur in alignments
moreover this algebra covers relations only between classes
here we introduce a new algebra of relations which first solves the limitation of the previous one and second incorporates all qualitative taxonomical relations including the relations  is a  and  is not 
all qualitative taxonomical relations that occur between concepts
all qualitative taxonomical relations that occur between individuals
we prove that this algebra is coherent with respect to the simple semantics of alignments
