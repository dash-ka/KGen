Unfortunately human crafted classifications do not tend to be too coarsegrained
Unfortunately human crafted classifications do not satisfy these criteria as human crafted classifications evolve too slowly
Current automated methods for generating ontologies of research areas also present a number of limitations such as i  Current automated methods for generating ontologies of research areas do not consider the rich amount of indirect statistical relationships
indirect statistical relationships which can help to understand the relation between two topics
indirect semantic relationships which can help to understand the relation between two topics
Current automated methods for generating ontologies of research areas also present a number of limitations such as i  Current automated methods for generating ontologies of research areas do not consider the rich amount of indirect semantic relationships
In this paper we present Klink2 by taking advantage of a variety of knowledge sources available on the web
a novel approach which improves on we earlier work on addresses the aforementioned limitations

this paper also separates ambiguous keywords into the appropriate distinct topics
this paper also identifies ambiguous keywords
we experimental evaluation shows that the ability of Klink2 to generate topics with accurate contextual meaning yields significant improvements over other algorithms in terms of both precision and recall
we experimental evaluation shows that the ability of Klink2 to integrate a high number of data sources
