analytics which can provide important insights into the research activity
the amount of scholarly data available on the web is steadily increasing enabling different types of analytics
in order to explore this largescale body of knowledge we need an accurate ontology of research topics
in order to make sense of we need an comprehensive ontology of research topics

unfortunately human crafted classifications do not satisfy these criteria as human crafted classifications evolve too slowly
unfortunately human crafted classifications do not tend to be too coarsegrained
indirect semantic relationships which can help to understand the relation between two topics
indirect statistical relationships which can help to understand the relation between two topics
current automated methods for generating ontologies of research areas also present a number of limitations such as i  current automated methods for generating ontologies of research areas do not consider the rich amount of indirect semantic relationships

this paper also identifies ambiguous keywords
this paper also separates ambiguous keywords into the appropriate distinct topics
we experimental evaluation shows that the ability of klink2 to generate topics with accurate contextual meaning yields significant improvements over other algorithms in terms of both precision and recall
we experimental evaluation shows that the ability of klink2 to integrate a high number of data sources
