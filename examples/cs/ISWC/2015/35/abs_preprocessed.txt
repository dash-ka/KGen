knowledge graphs are knowledge discovery activities
knowledge graphs are browsing
knowledge graphs are a key ingredient for searching
motivated by the need to harness knowledge available in a variety of knowledge graphs we face the following two problems
entities defined in some knowledge graph relatedness
first given a pair of entities defined in some knowledge graph find an explanation of a pair of entities
we formalize the notion of relatedness explanation
entities defined in some knowledge graph combinations
we introduce different criteria to build explanations based on diversity
we introduce different criteria to build explanations based on informationtheory
we introduce different criteria to build explanations based on a pair of entities
second given a pair of entities find pairs of  entities
second given a pair of entities find other  entities
pairs of  entities sharing a similar relatedness perspective
other  entities sharing a similar relatedness perspective
a tool called recap
recap which is based on rdf
recap which is based on sparql
we describe an implementation of we ideas in a tool
we provide an evaluation of recap
we provide a comparison with related systems on realworld data
