the web of linked data is composed of tons of rdf documents
rdf documents interlinked to each other forming a huge repository of distributed semantic data
effectively querying this distributed data source is an important open problem in the semantic web area
in this paper we propose a declarative language to query linked data on the web
in this paper we propose ldql 
separately patterns that describe web navigation paths
one of the novelties of ldql is that one of the novelties of ldql expresses separately patterns
separately patterns that describe the expected query result
web navigation paths that select the data sources to be used for computing the result
we study the expressiveness of the language
we present a formal syntax and semantics prove equivalence rules
the query formalisms that have been proposed previously for linked data on the web
in particular we show that ldql is strictly more expressive than the query formalisms
queries for which a complete execution is not computationally feasible over the web
the high expressiveness allows ldql to define queries
queries satisfying a syntactic sufficient condition
we formally study this issue queries are ensured to have a procedure to be effectively evaluated over the web of linked data
we formally provide a syntactic sufficient condition to avoid this problem queries are ensured to have a procedure to be effectively evaluated over the web of linked data
