large knowledge bases such as dbpedia are most often created heuristically due to scalability issues
in the building process both random errors may occur
in the building process both systematic errors may occur
in this paper we focus on finding systematic errors in dbpedia
in this paper we focus on antipatterns in dbpedia
we show that by combining clustering of the reasoning results errors can be identified at a minimal workload for the knowledge base designer
we show that by aligning the dbpedia ontology to the foundational ontology dolcezero errors can be identified at a minimal workload for the knowledge base designer
we show that by combining reasoning of the reasoning results errors can be identified at a minimal workload for the knowledge base designer
