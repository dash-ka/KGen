Instance retrieval computes all instances of a given concept in a consistent description logic  ontology
Instance retrieval computes all instances of a given concept in DL  ontology
Although Instance retrieval is a popular task for ontology reasoning there is no scalable method for instance retrieval for negated concepts by now
This paper studies a new approach to instance retrieval for negated concepts
This paper studies a new approach to instance retrieval for negated concepts based on query rewriting
The IFOrewritable class called the inconsistencybased firstorder rewritable  class is identified
The IFOrewritable class called IFOrewritable  class is identified
The IFOrewritable class guarantees that instance retrieval for an atomic negation can be reduced to answering a disjunction of conjunctive queries  CQs  over the ABox
the firstorder rewritable class which guarantees that answering a CQ is reducible to answering a disjunction of CQs over the ABox regardless of the TBox
The IFOrewritable class is more expressive than the firstorder rewritable class
Two sufficient conditions are proposed to detect IFOrewritable ontologies
IFOrewritable ontologies that are not firstorder rewritable
A rewritingbased method for retrieving instances of a negated concept is proposed for IFOrewritable ontologies
Preliminary experimental results on retrieving instances of all atomic negations show that A rewritingbased method for retrieving instances of a negated concept is significantly more efficient than existing methods
