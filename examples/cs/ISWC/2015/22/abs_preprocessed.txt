Instance matching has emerged as an important problem in the Semantic Web with machine learning methods
machine learning methods proving especially effective
To enhance performance taskspecific knowledge is typically used to introduce bias in the model selection problem
Such biases tend to be exploited by practitioners in a piecemeal fashion
a framework where the model selection design process is represented as a factor graph
This paper introduces a framework
Nodes in this bipartite graphical model represent opportunities for explicitly introducing bias
The graph is first used to unify common biases in the design of existing instance matchers
The graph is first used to visualize common biases in the design of existing instance matchers
As a direct application we then use The graph to hypothesize about potential unexploited biases
The hypotheses are evaluated by training 1032 neural networks on three instance matching tasks on Microsoft Azures cloudbased platform
An analysis over 25 GB of experimental data indicates that the proposed biases can improve efficiency by over 65
