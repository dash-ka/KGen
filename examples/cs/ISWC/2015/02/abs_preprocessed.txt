Federated query engines provide a unified query interface to federations of SPARQL endpoints
Replicating data fragments from different Linked Data sources facilitates data reorganization to better fit federated query processing needs of data consumers
However existing federated query engines are not designed to support replication are not replicated data performance
However existing federated query engines are not replicated data can negatively impact existing federated query engines are not designed to support replication

In this paper we formulate the source selection problem with fragment replication
For a given set of endpoints with replicated fragments the source selection problem with the source selection problem with fragment replication RRB is to select the endpoints
the endpoints that minimize the number of tuples to be transferred
For a given set of endpoints with a SPARQL query the source selection problem with the source selection problem with fragment replication RRB is to select the endpoints
For a given set of endpoints with replicated fragments the source selection problem with fragment replication RRB is to select the endpoints
For a given set of endpoints with a SPARQL query the source selection problem with fragment replication RRB is to select the endpoints
the Fedra source selection algorithm that approximates the source selection problem with fragment replication
We devise the Fedra source selection algorithm
We implement Fedra in the stateoftheart federated query engines
the stateoftheart federated query engines FedX and empirically evaluate We performance
the stateoftheart federated query engines ANAPSID and empirically evaluate We performance
Experimental results suggest that Fedra in the stateoftheart federated query engines ANAPSID efficiently solves the source selection problem with fragment replication reducing the number of selected SPARQL endpoints
Experimental results suggest that Fedra in the stateoftheart federated query engines ANAPSID efficiently solves the source selection problem with fragment replication reducing the size of query intermediate results
