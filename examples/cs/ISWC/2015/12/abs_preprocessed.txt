Ontologybased data access is a recent paradigm for accessing data sources through an ontology
declarative mappings that connect an ontology
an ontology that acts as a conceptual integrated view of the data to the data sources
an ontology that acts as a conceptual integrated view of the data
Ontologybased data access is a recent paradigm for accessing data sources through declarative mappings
We study the formal analysis of mappings in Ontologybased data access
Specifically We focus on the problem of identifying two of the most important anomalies for mappings in Ontologybased data access
Specifically We focus on the problem of identifying mapping inconsistency and redundancy 
We consider a wide range of ontology languages
ontology languages that examine mapping languages of different expressiveness over relational databases
ontology languages that comprises all OWL 2 profiles
ontology languages that comprises OWL 2
We provide algorithms
the decision problems associated with mapping inconsistency and redundancy
We establish tight complexity bounds for the decision problems
an ontology that acts as a conceptual integrated view of the data
an ontology that acts over the relational database schema
We results prove that in We general framework such forms of mapping analysis enjoy nice computational properties in the sense that such forms of mapping analysis are not harder than standard reasoning tasks over an ontology
