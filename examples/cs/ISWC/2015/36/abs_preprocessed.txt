latent variable models have increasingly gained attention for the statistical modeling of knowledge graphs
tasks related to knowledge graph completion
attention for the statistical modeling of knowledge graphs showing promising results in tasks
tasks related to cleaning
relationtypes that allow machines to understand the notion of things semantic relationships
besides storing facts about the world schemabased knowledge graphs are backed by rich semantic descriptions of relationtypes

relationtypes that allow machines to understand the notion of machines semantic relationships
in this work we study how typeconstraints can generally support the statistical modeling with latent variable models
more precisely we integrated prior knowledge in form of typeconstraints in various state of the art latent variable approaches
we experimental results show that prior knowledge on relationtypes significantly improves latent variable models up to 77
