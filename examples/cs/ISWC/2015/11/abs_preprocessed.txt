In this paper we tackle the problem of answering SPARQL queries over virtually integrated databases
explicit information is available about which records in the different databases refer to the same real world entity
we assume that the entity resolution problem has already been solved
Surprisingly to the best of our knowledge there has been no attempt to extend the standard OntologyBased Data Access
the standard OntologyBased Data Access setting to take into account these DB links for SPARQL queryanswering
the standard OntologyBased Data Access setting to take into account these DB links for consistency checking
This is partly because the OWL builtin owl the most natural representation of links between data sets is not included in the de facto ontology language for the standard OntologyBased Data Access
This is partly because the OWL builtin owl the most natural representation of links between data sets is not included in OWL 2 QL 
This is partly because the OWL builtin owl sameAs property  is not included in the de facto ontology language for the standard OntologyBased Data Access
This is partly because the OWL builtin owl sameAs property  is not included in OWL 2 QL 
our formally treat several fundamental questions in this context how links over database identifiers can be represented in terms of owl sameAs statements how to recover rewritability of SPARQL into SQL  lost because of owl

Moreover our investigate how our solution can be made to scale up to large enterprise datasets
experiments showing our scalability
our carried out an extensive set of experiments
our have implemented the approach
