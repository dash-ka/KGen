Ontologies are complex intellectual artifacts
creating Ontologies requires significant expertise and effort
While methodologies propose ways of building ontologies in a normative way empirical investigations of how experts actually construct ontologies  in the wild  are rare
While existing ontologyediting tools propose ways of building ontologies in a normative way empirical investigations of how experts actually construct ontologies  in the wild  are rare
Yet understanding actual user behavior can play an important role in the design of effective tool support
Although previous empirical investigations have produced a series of interesting insights previous empirical investigations were exploratory in nature
Although previous empirical investigations have produced a series of interesting insights previous empirical investigations were aimed at gauging the problem space only
In this work we aim to advance the state of knowledge in this domain by systematically defining a set of hypotheses about how users edit ontologies
In this work we aim to advance the state of knowledge in this domain by systematically comparing a set of hypotheses about how users edit ontologies
Towards that end we study the user editing trails of four realworld ontologyengineering projects
Using a coherent research framework we derive formal definitions of hypotheses from the literature and systematically compare previous empirical investigations with each other
a coherent research framework called HypTrails
user editing behavior followed by the entity similarity
Our findings suggest that the hierarchical structure of an ontology exercises the strongest influence on user editing behavior
Our findings suggest that the hierarchical structure of an ontology exercises the strongest influence on the semantic distance of classes in the ontology
Moreover Our findings are strikingly consistent across all ontologyengineering projects in our study with only minor exceptions for one of the smaller datasets
our believe that our results are important for ontology tools builders
our believe that our results are important for project managers
project managers who can potentially leverage this information to create user interfaces and processes
user interfaces and processes that better support the observed editing patterns of users
