Semantic relatedness are fundamental problems for linking text documents to the Web of Data
disambiguation are fundamental problems for linking text documents to the Web of Data
There are many approaches
many approaches dealing with both problems rely on word distribution over Wikipedia
many approaches dealing with both most of both problems rely on concept distribution over Wikipedia
many approaches dealing with both problems rely on concept distribution over Wikipedia
many approaches dealing with both most of both problems rely on word distribution over Wikipedia
concepts that do not have a rich textual description
both problems are therefore not applicable to concepts
In this paper we show that semantic relatedness can also be accurately computed by analysing only the graph structure of the knowledge base
In addition we propose a joint approach to entity disambiguation
wordsense disambiguation that makes use of graphbased relatedness
entity disambiguation that makes use of graphbased relatedness
In addition we propose a joint approach to wordsense disambiguation
As opposed to the majority of stateoftheart systems entities we use we approach to disambiguate both entities
stateoftheart systems that target mainly named
As opposed to the majority of stateoftheart systems entities we use we approach to disambiguate both common nouns
In we experiments we first show that our relatedness measure performs better than related stateoftheart graph
related stateoftheart graph based measures
In we experiments we first validate we relatedness measure on ground truth datasets
In we experiments we first validate we relatedness measure on multiple knowledge bases
Afterwards we show that the disambiguation algorithm also achieves superior disambiguation accuracy with respect to alternative stateoftheart graphbased algorithms
Afterwards we evaluate the disambiguation algorithm
