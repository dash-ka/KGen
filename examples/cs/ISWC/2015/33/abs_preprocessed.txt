We present Ackermann for forgetting concept symbols in ontologies
ontologies specified in the description logic ALCOI
Ackermann is an adaptation and improvement of a secondorder quantifier elimination method developed for modal logics
Ackermann is an adaptation and improvement of a secondorder quantifier elimination method used for computing correspondence properties for modal axioms
an approach exploiting a result of Ackermann
It follows an approach adapted to description logics
An important feature inherited from the modal approach
An important feature is that the inference rules are guided by an ordering compatible with the elimination order of the concept symbols
This provides more control over the inference process and reduces nondeterminism resulting in a smaller search space
Ackermann is extended with a new case splitting inference rule
Ackermann is extended with several simplification rules
Compared to related uniform interpolation methods for description logics Ackermann can handle inverse roles nominals and ABoxes
Compared to related forgetting interpolation methods for description logics Ackermann can handle inverse roles nominals and ABoxes
Compared to the modal approach Ackermann improves the success rates
the modal approach on which Ackermann is based
Compared to the modal approach Ackermann is more efficient in time
Ackermann has been implemented in Java using the OWL API
Experimental results show that the order affects efficiency
the order in which the concept symbols are eliminated significantly
Experimental results show that the order affects the success rate
