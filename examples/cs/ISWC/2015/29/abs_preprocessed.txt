propagation which propagates only interesting parts of updates from the source to the target dataset
In this paper we introduce an approach for interestbased RDF update propagation
Effectively this enables remote applications to  subscribe  to relevant datasets and consistently reflect the necessary changes locally without the need to frequently replace the entire dataset  or a relevant subset 
graphpatternbased interest expressions that is used to filter interesting parts of updates from the source
we approach is based on a formal definition for graphpatternbased interest expressions
we implement the approach in the iRap framework
we perform a comprehensive evaluation based on DBpedia Live updates to confirm the validity
value of we approach
