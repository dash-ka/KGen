Entity navigation over Linked Data often follows semantic links by using Linked Data browsers
With the increasing volume of Linked Data the rich links make it difficult for users to find target entities
With the increasing volume of Linked Data the diverse links make it difficult for users to traverse the link graph
With the increasing volume of Linked Data the diverse links make it difficult for users to find target entities
With the increasing volume of Linked Data the rich links make it difficult for users to traverse the link graph
Besides there is singleentityoriented transition
Besides there is a necessity for navigation paradigm to take into account
Besides there is entitysetoriented transition
To facilitate entity navigation we propose a novel concept and introduce link pattern lattice to organize semantic links when browsing an entity
To facilitate entity navigation we propose a novel concept and introduce link pattern lattice to organize semantic links when browsing a set of entities
a novel concept called link pattern
Furthermore to help users quickly find target entities topK link patterns are selected for entity navigation
The proposed approach is implemented in a prototype system
The proposed approach is then compared with two Linked Data browsers via a user study
Experimental results show that The proposed approach is effective
