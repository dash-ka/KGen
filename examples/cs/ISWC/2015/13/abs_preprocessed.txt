We present a novel approach to denote mappings between ELbased ontologies
ELbased ontologies which are defeasible in the sense that such a mapping only applies to individuals if this does not because an inconsistency
this provides the advantage of handling exceptions automatically
this provides the advantage of avoiding logical inconsistencies
logical inconsistencies that may be caused due to the traditional type of mappings
We consider the case
the case where mappings from many possibly heterogeneous ontologies are oneway links towards an overarching ontology
Questions can then be asked in terms of the concepts in the overarching ontology
We show that reasoning under such a setting is decidable even when the defeasible axioms apply to unknowns
We provide the formal semantics for the defeasible mappings
Furthermore We show that the formal semantics for the defeasible mappings actually is strongly related to the idea of answer sets for logic programs
