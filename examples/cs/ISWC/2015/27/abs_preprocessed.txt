The increasing amount of data on the Web particular of Linked Data has led to a diverse landscape of datasets
datasets which make entity retrieval a challenging task
in particular of Linked Data has led to a diverse landscape of datasets
Explicit crossdataset links for instance to indicate related entities can significantly improve entity retrieval
Explicit crossdataset links for instance to indicate coreferences can significantly improve entity retrieval
However only a small fraction of entities are interlinked through explicit statements
In this paper we propose a twofold entity retrieval approach
In offline preprocessing step we cluster entities based on the xmeans
In a first  we cluster entities based on spectral clustering algorithms
In a first  we cluster entities based on the xmeans
In offline preprocessing step we cluster entities based on spectral clustering algorithms
retrieval model which takes advantage of we
an optimized retrieval model
In the second step we propose an precomputed clusters
the result set with relevant entities by considering features of the precomputed clusters
For a given set of entities we further expand the result
the result set with relevant entities by considering features of entities
entities retrieved by the BM25F retrieval approach
entities retrieved by a given user query
the result set with relevant entities by considering features of the queries
Finally we rerank the expanded result
the expanded result set with respect to the relevance to the query
we perform a thorough experimental evaluation on the Billions Triple Challenge  dataset
we perform a thorough experimental evaluation on BTC12  dataset
the BM25F retrieval approach shows significant improvements compared to the baseline and state of the art approaches
