we tackle the problem of resolving coreferences in textual content by leveraging semantic web techniques
potential semantic annotations that can be added to the identified mentions
specifically we focus on noun phrases the challenge in this context is to improve the coreference resolution by leveraging potential semantic annotations
identifiable entities that appear in the text
noun phrases that coreference identifiable entities
we system sanaphor first applies stateoftheart techniques to extract candidate coreferences
we system sanaphor first applies stateoftheart techniques to extract entities
we system sanaphor first applies stateoftheart techniques to extract noun phrases
an inverted index built on top of a knowledge graph 
an inverted index built on top of eg dbpedia 
then we propose an approach to type noun phrases
type noun phrases using an inverted index
merging coreference clusters
finally we use the semantic relatedness of the introduced types to improve the stateoftheart techniques by splitting
we evaluate sanaphor on conll datasets
we show how we techniques consistently improve the state of the art in coreference resolution
