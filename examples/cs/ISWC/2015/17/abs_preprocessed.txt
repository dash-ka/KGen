a certain normal form which includes conjunctive queries
a certain normal form which includes positive queries possibly extended with a controlled form of negation
Levesques proper knowledge bases  correspond to infinite sets of ground negative facts with the notable property that for FOL formulas in a certain normal form entailment reduces to formula evaluation
Levesques proper knowledge bases  correspond to infinite sets of ground positive facts with the notable property that for FOL formulas in a certain normal form entailment reduces to formula evaluation
proper KBs  correspond to infinite sets of ground positive facts with the notable property that for FOL formulas in a certain normal form entailment reduces to formula evaluation
proper KBs  correspond to infinite sets of ground negative facts with the notable property that for FOL formulas in a certain normal form entailment reduces to formula evaluation
However proper KBs represent extensional knowledge only
In description logic terms proper KBs correspond to ABoxes
In this paper we augment proper KBs with DLLite TBoxes expressing the ontology of the domain 
In this paper we augment proper KBs with DLLite TBoxes expressing intensional knowledge 
In this paper we augment proper KBs with DLLite TBoxes expressing ie of the domain 
DLLite has the notable property that conjunctive query answering over TBoxes is reducible to formula evaluation over the ABox only
DLLite has the notable property that conjunctive query answering over standard description logic ABoxes is reducible to formula evaluation over the ABox only
ABoxes consisting of proper KBs
Here we investigate whether such a property extends to ABoxes
Specifically we consider extitDLLite  rdfs
Specifically we consider roughly corresponding to RDFS
Specifically we consider extitDLLite  core roughly corresponding to OWL 2 QL
Specifically we consider two DLLite variants
We show that when a extitDLLite  rdfs TBox is coupled with a proper KB a extitDLLite  rdfs TBox can be compiled away reducing query answering to evaluation on the proper KB alone
But this reduction is no longer possible when We associate proper KBs with extitDLLite  core TBoxes
Indeed We show that in the latter case query answering even for conjunctive queries becomes coNPhard in data complexity
