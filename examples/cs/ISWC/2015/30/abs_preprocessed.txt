automated acquisition
automated acquisition of ontologies has attracted research attention because automated acquisition of ontologies can help ontology engineers build ontologies
automated acquisition of ontologies has attracted research attention because automated acquisition of ontologies can give domain experts new insights into domain experts data

automated acquisition of ontologies has attracted research attention because automated acquisition of ontologies can help ontology engineers build ontologies
human involvement make assumptions about data do not fully respect background knowledge
existing approaches to ontology automated acquisition are considerably limited
eg focus on automated acquisition descriptions for given classes require intense supervision
however
we investigate the problem of general terminology induction ie automated acquisition sets of general class inclusions gcis from data
we investigate the problem of general terminology induction ie automated acquisition sets of general class inclusions gcis from background knowledge
measures that evaluate statistical quality of a set of gcis
we introduce measures
measures that evaluate logical quality of a set of gcis
we present methods to compute an anytime algorithm
we present methods to compute these measures
an anytime algorithm that induces sets of gcis
we experiments show that we can acquire interesting sets of gcis
we experiments show that we can provide insights into the structure of the search space
