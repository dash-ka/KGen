recently web search engines have empowered web search engines search with knowledge graphs to satisfy increasing demands of complex information needs about entities
a structured summary called knowledge card
each engine offers an online knowledge graph service to display highly relevant information about the query entity in form of a structured summary
the cards from different engines might be complementary
therefore it is necessary to fuse knowledge cards from different engines to get a comprehensive view
such a problem can be considered as a new branch of ontology alignment
ontology alignment which is actually an onthefly online data fusion based on the users needs
in this paper we present the first effort to work on knowledge cards fusion
we propose a novel probabilistic scoring algorithm for card disambiguation to select the most likely entity a card should refer to
we then design a learningbased method to align properties from cards
cards representing the same entity
finally we perform value deduplication to group equivalent values of the aligned properties as value clusters
the experimental results show that we approach outperforms the state of the art ontology alignment algorithms in terms of recall
