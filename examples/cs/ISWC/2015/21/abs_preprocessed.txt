one of the main challenges in the data web is the identification of instances
instances that refer to the same realworld entity
current instance matching benchmarks
the necessary insights pertaining to how current frameworks behave when dealing with real data
choosing the right framework for this purpose remains tedious as current instance fail to provide end users and developers with the necessary insights
benchmark generator which focuses on benchmarking instance matching systems for linked data
a domainindependent instance matching benchmark generator
in this paper we present a domainindependent instance
in this paper we present lance
the standard test cases related to structure transformations
lance is the first linked data benchmark generator to support the standard test cases
the standard test cases related to value transformations
complex semanticsaware test cases that take into account expressive owl constructs
lance is the first linked data benchmark generator to support complex semanticsaware test cases
lance supports the definition of matching tasks with varying degrees of difficulty
lance produces a weighted gold standard
a weighted gold standard which allows a more finegrained analysis of the performance of instance matching tools
the data web accompanying schema as input to produce a target dataset
the data web can accept the data web
a target dataset implementing test cases of varying levels of difficulty
the data web can accept any linked dataset
we provide a comparative analysis with lance benchmarks to identify the capabilities of state of the art instance matching an evaluation to demonstrate the scalability of lances test case generator
we provide a comparative analysis with lance benchmarks to assess the capabilities of state of the art instance matching systems to demonstrate the scalability of lances test case generator
