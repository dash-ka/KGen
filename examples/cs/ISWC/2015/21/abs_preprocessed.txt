instances that refer to the same realworld entity
One of the main challenges in the Data Web is the identification of instances
the necessary insights pertaining to how current frameworks behave when dealing with real data
Choosing the right framework for this purpose remains tedious as current instance fail to provide end users and developers with the necessary insights
current instance matching benchmarks
In this paper we present lance
a domainindependent instance matching benchmark generator
benchmark generator which focuses on benchmarking instance matching systems for Linked Data
In this paper we present a domainindependent instance
the standard test cases related to value transformations
the standard test cases related to structure transformations
lance is the first Linked Data benchmark generator to support complex semanticsaware test cases
complex semanticsaware test cases that take into account expressive OWL constructs
lance is the first Linked Data benchmark generator to support the standard test cases
lance supports the definition of matching tasks with varying degrees of difficulty
a weighted gold standard which allows a more finegrained analysis of the performance of instance matching tools
lance produces a weighted gold standard
a target dataset implementing test cases of varying levels of difficulty
the Data Web can accept any linked dataset
the Data Web can accept the Data Web
the Data Web accompanying schema as input to produce a target dataset
We provide a comparative analysis with lance benchmarks to identify the capabilities of state of the art instance matching systems to demonstrate the scalability of lances test case generator
