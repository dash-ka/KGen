rdf is an increasingly important paradigm for the representation of information on the web
sophisticated graph matching queries expressible in languages like sparql become increasingly important
as rdf databases increase in size to approach tens of millions of triples scalability becomes an issue
as rdf databases increase in size as sophisticated graph scalability becomes an issue
a way that makes the index diskresident
to date there is no graphbased indexing method for rdf data where the index was designed in a way
indexes that can operate efficiently when the index the index resides on disk
there is therefore a growing need for indexes
in this paper we first propose the dogma index for fast subgraph matching on disk
in this paper we develop a basic algorithm to answer queries over the index
algorithm that uses efficient  but correct  pruning strategies when combined with two different extensions of the index
an optimized algorithm
a basic algorithm is then significantly sped up via an
four existing rdf database systems developed by others
we have implemented a preliminary system
we have tested a preliminary system against four existing rdf database systems
four existing rdf database systems developed by others with orders of magnitude improvements for complex graph queries
we experiments show that a basic algorithm performs very well compared to four existing rdf database systems
