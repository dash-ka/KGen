Recently the W3C Linking Open Data effort has boosted the publication and interlinkage of large amounts of RDF datasets on the Semantic Web

RDF triples aggregated from different heterogeneous sources
Recording provenance information of RDF triples is crucial in order to effectively support privacy policies
Recording provenance information of RDF triples is crucial in order to effectively support trust mechanisms
Recording provenance information of RDF triples is crucial in order to effectively support digital rights
Managing provenance becomes even more important when we consider not only explicitly stated for querying RDF graphs
Managing provenance becomes even more important when we consider not only explicitly stated for updating RDF graphs
Managing provenance becomes even more important when we consider implicit triples  through RDFS inference rules  in conjunction with declarative languages for querying RDF graphs

In this paper we rely on colored RDF triples represented as quadruples to manipulate explicit provenance information
In this paper we rely on colored RDF triples represented as quadruples to capture explicit provenance information
