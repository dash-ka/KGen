scenarios where selected subontologies of a large ontology are offered as views to users based on criteria like the users access right
the framework can deal with scenarios
the trust level required by the application
the framework can deal with the level of detail
detail requested by the users
the framework can deal with the trust level
the framework developed in this paper
instead of materializing a large number of different subontologies we propose to keep just one ontology
instead of materializing a large number of different subontologies we propose to equip each axiom with the consequence label
the corresponding subontology is determined by comparing the consequence label with the axiom labels
the access right required trust level is then also represented by a label  called user label  from an appropriate labeling lattice
for largescale ontologies certain consequence  like the concept hierarchy  are often precomputed
instead of precomputing these consequences for every possible subontology our approach computes just one label for each consequence such that a comparison of the user label with the consequence label determines whether the consequence follows from the corresponding subontology or not
