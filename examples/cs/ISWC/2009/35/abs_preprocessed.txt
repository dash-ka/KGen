the discovery of all subclass relationships between class names occurring in an ontology
the core services provided by owl reasoners
one of the core services is classification the discovery of all subclass relationships between class names
discovering these relations can be computationally expensive if the number of class names is large
discovering these relations can be computationally expensive particularly if individual subsumption tests are costly
we present a classification algorithm
a classification algorithm which exploits partial information about subclass relationships to reduce both the number of individual tests
a classification algorithm which exploits partial information about subclass relationships to reduce both the cost of working with large ontologies
we also describe techniques for extracting such partial information from existing reasoners
