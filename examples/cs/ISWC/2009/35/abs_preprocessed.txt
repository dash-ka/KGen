One of the core services is classification the discovery of all subclass relationships between class names
the discovery of all subclass relationships between class names occurring in an ontology
the core services provided by OWL reasoners
Discovering these relations can be computationally expensive if the number of class names is large
Discovering these relations can be computationally expensive particularly if individual subsumption tests are costly
a classification algorithm which exploits partial information about subclass relationships to reduce both the number of individual tests
We present a classification algorithm
a classification algorithm which exploits partial information about subclass relationships to reduce both the cost of working with large ontologies
We also describe techniques for extracting such partial information from existing reasoners
Empirical results from a prototypical implementation demonstrate substantial performance improvements compared to implementations
