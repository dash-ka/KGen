Semantic formalisms represent content in a uniform way according to ontologies
This enables reasoning via eg Semantic Web services 
This enables manipulation via automated means

view that originates from knowledge representation motivations
This limits the users ability to explore the semantic data from a point of view
This enables reasoning via automated means 
We show how for user consumption a visualization of semantic data according to eg space  provides effective sensemaking of data
We show how for user consumption a visualization of semantic data according to eg time  provides effective sensemaking of data
We show how for user consumption a visualization of semantic data according to some easily graspable dimensions  provides effective sensemaking of data
In this paper we propose multiple visualization strategies to support the exploration of semanticrich data
In this paper we propose dynamic filters to support the exploration of semanticrich data
In this paper we look holistically at the interaction between users
In this paper we look holistically at the interaction between semantic data
We discuss a user evaluation
We discuss how interaction challenges could be overcome to create an effective usercentred framework for the visualization and manipulation of semantic data
