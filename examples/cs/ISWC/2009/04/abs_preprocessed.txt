ontocase is a framework for semiautomatic patternbased ontology construction
in this paper we focus on the reuse phases where an initial ontology is enriched based on content ontology design patterns 
in this paper we focus on the retain phases where an initial ontology is enriched based on especially the implementation and evaluation of these phases

in this paper we focus on the retain phases where an initial ontology is enriched based on content ontology design patterns 
in this paper we focus on the retain phases where an initial ontology is enriched based on content odps 
in this paper we focus on the reuse phases where an initial ontology is enriched based on content odps 
applying content odps within semiautomatic ontology construction ie ontology learning is a novel approach
ontologies constructed automatically based on odps
the main contributions of this paper are the methods for the subsequent evaluation
the main contributions of this paper are the methods for pattern ranking
the main contributions of this paper are the methods for pattern selection
the subsequent evaluation showing the characteristics of ontologies
the main contributions of this paper are the methods for pattern integration
we show that it is possible to improve the results of existing ontology learning methods by selecting content odps
we show that it is possible to improve the results of existing ontology learning methods by reusing content odps
by exploiting background knowledge the ontology is given a richer overall structure
ontocase is able to introduce a general top structure into the ontologies
