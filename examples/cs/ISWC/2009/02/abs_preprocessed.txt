stateoftheart discovery of semantic web services is based on hybrid algorithms
hybrid algorithms that combine syntactic matchmaking
hybrid algorithms that combine semantic matchmaking
the results returned by the service
these approaches are purely based on similarity measures between parameters of a service request
these approaches are available service descriptions which however fail to completely capture the actual functionality of the service
these approaches are the quality of the results
on the other hand with the advent of web 20 collaboration has become an increasingly popular trend
on the other hand with the advent of web 20 active user participation has become an increasingly popular trend
users often rate providing valuable information improve the accuracy of search results
users often group relevant items thus providing valuable information improve the accuracy of search results
valuable information that can be taken into account to further
in this paper we tackle this issue by proposing a method to further improve the results of the matchmaker
a method that combines multiple matching criteria with user feedback
we extend a previously proposed dominancebased approach for service discovery
we describe how user feedback is incorporated in the matchmaking process
we evaluate the performance of we approach using a publicly available collection of owls services
