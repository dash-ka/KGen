RDF data are usually accessed using one of two methods either graphs are rendered in forms perceivable by eg in tabular 
eg in tabular  which are difficult to handle for large data sets
eg in graphical form  which are difficult to handle for large data sets
human users  which are difficult to handle for large data sets

Alternatively query languages like SPARQL provide means to express information needs in structured form hence query languages like SPARQL are targeted towards experts

Inspired by the concept of spreadsheet tools we have investigated mechanisms yet formally grounded manner
mechanisms that allow we to access RDF graphs in a more intuitive and manageable
spreadsheet tools where users can perform relatively complex calculations by splitting formulas and values across multiple cells
In this paper we make three contributions towards this direction
First we present RDFunctions an algebra contained in a background graph
an algebra that consists of mappings between sets of blank nodes  under consideration of the triples
an algebra that consists of mappings between sets of literals  under consideration of the triples
an algebra that consists of mappings between sets of URIs  under consideration of the triples
an algebra that consists of mappings between sets of RDF language elements  under consideration of the triples
RDFunctions which can be edited evaluated
Second we define a syntax for expressing RDFunctions
RDFunctions which can be edited parsed
RDFunctions using a spreadsheet metaphor
Third we discuss an implementation of RDFunctions
Third we discuss Tripcel
Using this tool users can easily execute function expressions
the data stored in an RDF graph
Using this tool users can easily perform analysis tasks on the data
Using this tool users can easily edit function expressions
