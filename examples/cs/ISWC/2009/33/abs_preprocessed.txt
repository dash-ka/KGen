spreadsheet tools where users can perform relatively complex calculations by splitting formulas and values across multiple cells
inspired by the concept of spreadsheet tools we have investigated mechanisms yet formally grounded manner
mechanisms that allow we to access rdf graphs in a more intuitive and manageable
in this paper we make three contributions towards this direction
first we present rdfunctions an algebra contained in a background graph
an algebra that consists of mappings between sets of blank nodes  under consideration of the triples
an algebra that consists of mappings between sets of rdf language elements  under consideration of the triples
an algebra that consists of mappings between sets of uris  under consideration of the triples
an algebra that consists of mappings between sets of literals  under consideration of the triples
rdfunctions which can be edited parsed
second we define a syntax for expressing rdfunctions
rdfunctions which can be edited evaluated
third we discuss an implementation of rdfunctions
rdfunctions using a spreadsheet metaphor
third we discuss tripcel
using this tool users can easily edit function expressions
using this tool users can easily perform analysis tasks on the data
using this tool users can easily execute function expressions
the data stored in an rdf graph
