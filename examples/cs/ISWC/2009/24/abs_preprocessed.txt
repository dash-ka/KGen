in this paper we investigate different technologies to attack the automatic solution of orchestration problems based on a collection of services available on a testbed
in this paper we investigate different technologies to attack the automatic solution of orchestration problems based on a semantically enriched description of the services
in this paper we investigate different technologies to attack the automatic solution of orchestration problems based on synthesis from declarative specifications
in addition to we previously presented tableauxbased synthesis technology we consider two structurally rather different approaches here using the highlevel programming language golog
golog that internally makes use of planning techniques
in addition to we previously presented tableauxbased synthesis technology we consider two structurally rather different approaches here using jmosel golog
in addition to we previously presented tableauxbased synthesis technology we consider two structurally rather different approaches here using we tool for monadic secondorder logic on strings golog
as a common case study we consider the mediation scenario of the semantic web service challenge
the semantic web service challenge which is a benchmark for process orchestration
all three synthesis solutions have been embedded in the jabcjeti modeling framework
all three synthesis solutions have been used to synthesize the abstract mediator processes concrete running  web  service counterpart
all three synthesis solutions have been used to synthesize all three synthesis solutions concrete running  web  service counterpart
using the jabc as a common frame helps highlighting the essential differences and similarities
it turns out at least at the level of complication of the all approaches behave quite similarly both considering the modeling

solutions answering questing like when the overhead to achieve compositionality pays of
we believe that turning the jabc framework into experimentation platform along the lines will help understanding the application profiles of the individual synthesis technologies
