The focus of web search is moving away from returning relevant documents towards returning structured data as results to user queries
linkbased ranking algorithms which however are targeted towards hypertext documents
A vital part in the architecture of search engines are linkbased ranking algorithms
vocabularies used
cases where data exhibits enormous variance in vocabularies
Existing ranking algorithms for structured data on the other hand require manual input of a domain expert
Existing ranking algorithms for structured data on the other hand are thus not applicable in cases
data integrated from a large number of sources
In such environments the authority of data sources is an important signal that the ranking algorithm has to take into account
This paper presents algorithms for prioritising data
web datasets expressed in RDF
prioritising data returned by queries over web datasets
the sources which can speak authoritatively for these identifiers
authority which provides a correspondence between these identifiers
We introduce the notion of naming authority
authority which provides a correspondence between the sources
these identifiers which can speak authoritatively for these identifiers
We then propagates the authority values to identifiers
identifiers referenced in the sources
We uses the original PageRank method to assign authority values to data sources based on a naming authority graph
We conduct performance evaluations of the method on a large web dataset
We conduct quality evaluations of the method on a large web dataset
the method on a large web dataset has applications in user interfaces over integrated datasets
the method on a large web dataset has applications in search query processing reasoning over integrated datasets
the method on a large web dataset is schemaindependent
the method on a large web dataset requires no manual input
