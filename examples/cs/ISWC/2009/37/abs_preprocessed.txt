the ways in which services can be composed
to direct automated web service composition it is compelling to provide a template workflow or scaffolding
a template workflow or scaffolding that dictates the ways
web service composition that builds on work
in this paper we present an approach to web service composition
work using hierarchical task networks for web service composition
work using ai planning for web service composition
composition based upon the needs of the available services
a significant advantage of we approach is that our approach provides much of the howto knowledge of a choreography while enabling optimization of composition
a significant advantage of we approach is that our approach provides much of the howto knowledge of a choreography while enabling customization of integrated web service selection
composition based upon the needs of the preferences of the customer

a significant advantage of we approach is that our approach provides much of the howto knowledge of a choreography while enabling customization of composition
composition based upon the needs of the specific problem
many customers must also be concerned with enforcement of regulations perhaps in the form of corporate policies andor government regulations
regulations are traditionally enforced at design time by verifying that a workflow or composition adheres to regulations
we approach supports optimization enforcement all at composition construction time
we approach supports customization enforcement all at composition construction time
we approach supports regulation enforcement all at composition construction time
to maximize efficiency we have developed novel search heuristics together with a branch
to maximize efficiency we bound search algorithm
search algorithm that enable the generation of high quality compositions with the performance of stateoftheart planning systems
