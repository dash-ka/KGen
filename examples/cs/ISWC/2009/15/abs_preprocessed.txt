process modeling is a core task in web service modeling in particular
process modeling is a core task in software engineering in general
process structures based on process entities ie process activities hierarchical relationship between activities and activities parts temporal relationships between activities conditions on process
the modeling of domain knowledge
the explicit management of process models for purposes such as process selection andor process reuse requires flexible retrieval of process structures flows
process structures based on relationships ie process activities hierarchical relationship between activities and activities parts temporal relationships between activities conditions on process
the explicit management of process models for purposes such as process selection andor process reuse requires intelligent retrieval of process structures flows
in this paper we analyze requirements for modeling of process models
in this paper we analyze requirements for querying of process models
in this paper we present a patternoriented approach exploiting owldl representation for expressive process modeling and retrieval
in this paper we present a patternoriented approach exploiting reasoning capabilities for expressive process modeling and retrieval
