in this paper a novel approach is presented for generating rdf graphs of arbitrary complexity from various spreadsheet layouts
currently none of the available spreadsheettordf wrappers supports cross tables and tables where data is not aligned in rows
similar to rdf123 xlwrap is based on template graphs where fragments of triples can be mapped to specific cells of a spreadsheet
additionally similar to rdf123 xlwrap features a full expression algebra based on the syntax of openoffice calc
openoffice calc which can be used to repeat similar mappings in order to wrap
additionally similar to rdf123 xlwrap features a full expression algebra based on the syntax of various shift operations
spreadsheet files
multiple sheets
various shift operations which can be used to repeat similar mappings in order to wrap cross tables
cross tables
openoffice calc which can be used to repeat similar mappings in order to wrap cross tables
various shift operations which can be used to repeat similar mappings in order to wrap
the set of available expression functions can be easily extended by users of xlwrap
the set of available expression functions includes most of the native functions of openoffice calc
