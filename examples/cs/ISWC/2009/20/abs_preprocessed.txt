predicates of predicates  are useful for representing relationships between predicate formulas and further predicates of predicates RRB conceptually yield a hierarchy similar to the hierarchies of predicates
Metalevel predicates  are useful for representing relationships between predicate formulas and further predicates of predicates RRB conceptually yield a hierarchy similar to the hierarchies of predicates

By extending the ordersorted Hornclause calculus we develop a queryanswering system
a queryanswering system that can answer queries such as atoms
metaatoms generalized by containing predicate variables
atoms generalized by containing predicate variables
a queryanswering system that can answer queries such as metaatoms
We show that the expressive queryanswering system computes every generalized the complexity of We query system is equal to that of DATALOG
We show that the expressive queryanswering system computes every generalized query in single exponential time query system is equal to that of DATALOG
