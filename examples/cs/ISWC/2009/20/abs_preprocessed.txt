metaatoms generalized by containing predicate variables
a queryanswering system that can answer queries such as atoms
a queryanswering system that can answer queries such as metaatoms
by extending the ordersorted hornclause calculus we develop a queryanswering system
atoms generalized by containing predicate variables
we show that the expressive queryanswering system computes every generalized the complexity of we query system is equal to that of datalog
we show that the expressive queryanswering system computes every generalized query in single exponential time query system is equal to that of datalog
