the ql profile of owl 2 has been designed so that it is possible to use database technology for query answering via query rewriting
we present a comparison of we resolution
we resolution based rewriting algorithm with the standard algorithm conducting an empirical evaluation using ontologies
ontologies derived from realistic applications
we resolution based rewriting algorithm with the standard algorithm conducting an empirical evaluation using queries
queries derived from realistic applications
we resolution based rewriting algorithm with the standard algorithm implementing both
the standard algorithm proposed by calvanese et al
the results indicate that our algorithm produces significantly smaller rewritings in most cases
most cases which could be important for practicality in realistic applications
