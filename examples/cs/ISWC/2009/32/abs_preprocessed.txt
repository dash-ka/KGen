Ontology matching is one of the key research topics in the field of the Semantic Web
many matching systems that generate mappings between different ontologies either automatically
There are many matching systems or semiautomatically
However the mappings semiautomatically may be inconsistent with the ontologies
many matching systems that generate mappings between different ontologies
However the mappings automatically may be inconsistent with the ontologies
However the mappings generated by many matching systems
Several approaches have been proposed to deal with the inconsistencies between mappings
Several approaches have been proposed to deal with the inconsistencies between ontologies
This problem is often called a mapping revision problem as the ontologies are assumed to be correct whereas ontologies are repaired when resolving the inconsistencies between mappings

In this paper we show that it can be characterized by two logical postulates adapted from some existing postulates for belief base revision
In this paper we first propose a conflictbased mapping revision operator
we then show that an algorithm defines a conflictbased mapping revision operator
we then provide an algorithm for iterative mapping revision by using an ontology revision operator
the iterative algorithm which result in three different mapping revision algorithms
Three concrete ontology revision operators are given to instantiate the iterative algorithm
we implement three different mapping revision algorithms
we provide some preliminary but interesting evaluation results
