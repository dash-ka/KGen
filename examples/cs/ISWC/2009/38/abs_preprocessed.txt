the dynamic nature of mobile environment means that users need fast approaches for service discovery
the dynamic nature of mobile environment means that users need accurate approaches for service discovery
in order achieve high accuracy semantic languages can be used in conjunction with logic reasoners
since powerful broker nodes are not always available  due to lack of long range connectivity  create a bottleneck  since mobile devices are all trying to access the same server  onboard mobile reasoning must be supported
since powerful broker nodes are not always available  due to lack of long range connectivity  create single point of failure  in the case that a central server fails  onboard mobile reasoning must be supported
however reasoners are notoriously resource do not scale to small devices
however reasoners are notoriously resource intensive scale to small devices
an efficient mobile reasoner which relaxes the complete matching approaches to support anytime reasoning
therefore in this paper we provide an efficient mobile reasoner
an efficient mobile reasoner which relaxes the current strict to support anytime reasoning
we provides a degree of match result to the user
we approach matches the most important request conditions  deemed by the user  first
we provides a degree of confidence result to the user
we provide performance evaluation of we work
we provide a prototype implementation of we work
