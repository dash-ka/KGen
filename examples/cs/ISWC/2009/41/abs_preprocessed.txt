forgetting is an important tool for reducing ontologies by eliminating some concepts and roles while preserving sound
forgetting is an important tool for reducing ontologies by eliminating some concepts and roles while preserving complete reasoning
these attempts have previously been made to address the problem of forgetting in relatively simple description logics such as dllite
these attempts extended el
the ontologies were kbs 
the ontologies used in these attempts
the ontologies were mostly restricted to tboxes 
the ontologies were mostly restricted to general knowledge bases 
however the issue of forgetting for general kbs in more expressive description logics such as owl relatively simple description logic is largely unexplored
however the issue of forgetting for general kbs in more expressive description logics such as alc is largely unexplored
in particular the problem of computing forgetting for such logics is still open
in particular the problem of characterizing forgetting for such logics is still open
