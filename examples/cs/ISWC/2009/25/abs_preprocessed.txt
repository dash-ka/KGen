Conjunctive query answering for EL ontologies has recently drawn much attention as the Description Logic EL captures the expressivity of many large ontologies in the biomedical domain and is the foundation for the OWL 2 EL profile
namely acyclic EL that supports role inclusions
In this paper we propose a practical approach for conjunctive query answering in a fragment of EL namely acyclic EL
a practical approach for conjunctive query answering can be implemented with low cost by leveraging any existing relational database management system to do the ABox data completion
a practical approach for conjunctive query answering can be implemented with query answering
We conducted a preliminary experiment to evaluate We approach using a large clinical data is practical
