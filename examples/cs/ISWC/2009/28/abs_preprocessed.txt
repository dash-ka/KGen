processing uncertain emergent knowledge that comes from multiple resources with varying relevance
we present a lightweight framework for processing uncertain emergent knowledge
a lightweight framework for processing uncertain emergent knowledge is essentially rdfcompatible
a lightweight framework for processing uncertain emergent knowledge allows also for direct representation of eg provenance
