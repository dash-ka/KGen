Large amounts pose the challenging question of appropriate relevance ranking for producing finegrained descriptions of the available data to guide the user along most promising knowledge aspects
high diversity of knowledge in The Semantic Web pose the challenging question of appropriate relevance ranking for producing finegrained descriptions of eg to guide the user along most promising knowledge aspects

Existing methods for graphbased authority ranking lack support for finegrained latent coherence between resources  ie support for link semantics in the linked data model

In this paper we present a novel approach for faceted authority ranking in the context of RDF knowledge bases
In this paper we present TripleRank 
TripleRank captures the additional latent semantics of The Semantic Web data by means of statistical methods in order to produce richer descriptions of the available data

a 3dimensional tensor that enables the seamless representation of arbitrary semantic links
We model The Semantic Web by a 3dimensional tensor
the PARAFAC decomposition which can be seen as a multimodal counterpart to Web authority ranking with HITS
For the analysis of that model we apply the PARAFAC decomposition
The result predicates that hub  properties with respect to identified topics
The result predicates that navigational  properties with respect to identified topics
The result are groupings of resources
The result predicates that characterize groupings of resources authority to identified topics
We gathered encouraging feedback in a user evaluation where TripleRank results have been exploited in a faceted browsing scenario
We have applied TripleRank to multiple data sets from the linked open data community
