The field of biomedicine has embraced the Semantic Web probably more than any other field
As a result there is a large number of biomedical ontologies
biomedical ontologies covering overlapping areas of The field of biomedicine
We have developed BioPortal 
We have developed an open communitybased repository of the ontologies themselves
We analyzed ontologies in the Unified Medical Language System creating more than 4 million mappings between concepts in these ontologies and terminologies based on the lexical similarity of concept names and synonyms
We analyzed terminologies in BioPortal creating more than 4 million mappings between concepts in these ontologies and terminologies based on the lexical similarity of concept names and synonyms
We analyzed terminologies in the Unified Medical Language System creating more than 4 million mappings between concepts in these ontologies and terminologies based on the lexical similarity of concept names and synonyms
We analyzed ontologies in BioPortal creating more than 4 million mappings between concepts in these ontologies and terminologies based on the lexical similarity of concept names and synonyms
the ways in which the mappings can help in the process of ontology design and evaluation
We then analyzed what the mappings tell us about the ontologies the mappings
We then analyzed what the mappings tell us about the structure of the ontology repository
We then analyzed what the mappings tell us about the ways
We then analyzed the mappings
For example we can use the mappings to guide users
For example we can use the mappings to guide background knowledge in domainspecific tools
users who are new to a field to the most pertinent ontologies in The field of biomedicine to identify which ontologies will serve
the domain that are not covered sufficiently by the ontologies themselves in the ontology repository
users who are new to a field to the most pertinent ontologies in The field of biomedicine to identify areas of the domain
While We used a specific  but large  ontology repository for the study we believe that the lessons we learned about the value of a largescale set of mappings to ontology users and developers apply in many other domains
