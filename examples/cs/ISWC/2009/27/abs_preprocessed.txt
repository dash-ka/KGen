Significant efforts have focused in the past years on bringing large amounts of metadata online
the success of Significant efforts can be seen by the impressive number of web sites exposing data in RDFa
the success of Significant efforts can be seen by the impressive number of web sites exposing data in RDFXML
However little is known about the extent to which this data fits the needs of ordinary web users with everyday information needs
In this paper we study what we perceive as the semantic gap between the supply of data on the Semantic Web in general needs of web users as expressed in the queries
In this paper we study what we perceive as the semantic gap between the supply of data on the Semantic Web in the needs of web users as expressed in the queries
the queries submitted to a major Web search engine
we perform we analysis on both ontologies
we perform we analysis on both the level of instances
First we first look at how much data is actually relevant to Web queries
First we first look what kind of data is it
Second we provide a generic method to extract the attributes that Web users are searching for regarding particular classes of entities
contrast class definitions found in the Semantic Web in general vocabularies with the attributes of objects that users are interested in
a generic method to extract the attributes that Web users are searching for regarding particular classes of entities allows to contrast class definitions
we findings are crucial to measuring the potential of semantic search
we findings also speak to the state of the Semantic Web in general
