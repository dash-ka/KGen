in practice there is a tremendous amount of data on the web
the web that is not available through the semantic web
in this paper we present an approach to automatically discover and create new semantic web services
the idea behind an approach is to discover similar sources extract the source data build semantic descriptions of the sources and then turn similar sources into semantic web services
the idea behind an approach is to start with a set of known sources extract the source data build semantic descriptions of the sources and then turn similar sources into semantic web services
the idea behind an approach is to start with a set of the corresponding semantic descriptions extract the source data build semantic descriptions of the sources and then turn similar sources into semantic web services
we implemented an endtoend solution to this problem in a system
a system called deimos across five different domains
a system called deimos
we evaluated a system
the results demonstrate that a system can automatically build semantic web services with only example sources descriptions as input
the results demonstrate that a system can automatically build semantic only example sources descriptions as input
the results demonstrate that a system can automatically discover
a system called deimos
the results demonstrate that a system can automatically learn semantic descriptions
