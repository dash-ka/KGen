The Web of Linked Data forms a single globally distributed dataspace
all data sources that might be relevant for query answering
Due to the openness of this dataspace it is not possible to know in advance all data sources
the openness of this dataspace poses a new challenge
a new challenge that is not addressed by traditional research on federated query processing
In this paper we present an approach to execute SPARQL queries over the Web of Linked Data
data that might be relevant for answering a query during the query execution the query execution
The main idea of we approach is to discover data itself
the query execution itself is driven by following RDF links between data sources based on The URIs
the query execution itself is driven by following RDF links between data sources based in partial results
The URIs are resolved over the HTTP protocol into RDF data
RDF data which is continuously added to the queried dataset
this paper describes concepts to implement our approach using an iteratorbased pipeline
this paper describes algorithms to implement our approach using an iteratorbased pipeline
we introduce a formalization of the pipelining approach and show that classical iterators may because blocking due to the latency of HTTP requests
To avoid blocking we propose an extension of the iterator paradigm
The evaluation of we approach shows the query execution itself strengths as well as the still existing challenges
