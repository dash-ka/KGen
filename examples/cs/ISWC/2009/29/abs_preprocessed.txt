An increasing number of scientific communities rely on Semantic Web ontologies to share data within and across research domains

These common knowledge representation resources are usually developed and maintained manually along with experimental evidence
These common knowledge representation resources are usually developed and maintained essentially coevolve along with experimental evidence
experimental evidence produced by scientists worldwide
Detecting automatically the differences between versions of the same ontology in order to store resources deltas is a challenging task for escience

In this paper we focus on languages
We propose a specific language
a change detection algorithm which is complete with respect to the proposed language
a change detection algorithm which is sound with respect to the proposed language
a specific language that provide a change detection algorithm
a specific language that provably exhibits those characteristics
Finally we provide a promising experimental evaluation of we framework
we framework using real ontologies from the bioinformatics domains
we framework using real ontologies from the cultural domains
