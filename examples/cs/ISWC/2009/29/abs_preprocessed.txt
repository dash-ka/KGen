an increasing number of scientific communities rely on semantic web ontologies to interpret data within and across research domains
an increasing number of scientific communities rely on semantic web ontologies to share data within and across research domains
these common knowledge representation resources are usually developed and maintained manually along with experimental evidence
these common knowledge representation resources are usually developed and maintained essentially coevolve along with experimental evidence
experimental evidence produced by scientists worldwide
visualize these common knowledge representation resources deltas is a challenging task for escience
detecting automatically the differences between versions of the same ontology in order to store resources deltas is a challenging task for escience
concise deltas which are expressive
languages allowing the formulation of intuitive deltas enough to describe unambiguously that can be efficiently detected
languages allowing the formulation of concise deltas enough to describe unambiguously that can be efficiently detected
languages allowing the formulation of concise deltas enough to describe unambiguously any possible change
intuitive deltas which are expressive
in this paper we focus on languages
languages allowing the formulation of intuitive deltas enough to describe unambiguously any possible change
languages allowing the formulation of intuitive deltas enough to describe unambiguously that can be effectively detected
languages allowing the formulation of concise deltas enough to describe unambiguously that can be effectively detected
a specific language that provide a change detection algorithm
we propose a specific language
a specific language that provably exhibits those characteristics
a change detection algorithm which is complete with respect to the proposed language
a change detection algorithm which is sound with respect to the proposed language
we framework using real ontologies from the cultural domains
finally we provide a promising experimental evaluation of we framework
we framework using real ontologies from the bioinformatics domains
