rdf schema as a lightweight ontology language is querying are needed
rdf schema as a lightweight ontology language is gaining popularity and consequently tools for scalable rdf schema inference are needed
sparql mostly provides means for querying simple rdf graphs only whereas querying with respect to other entailment regimes is left outside the current specification
sparql mostly provides means for querying simple rdf graphs only whereas querying with respect to rdf schema is left outside the current specification
sparql has become recently a w3c standard for querying rdf data
in this paper
rdf datasets that comprise multiple named graphs
we provide an extension for sparql that remedies these effects
we show that sparql faces certain unwanted ramifications when querying ontologies in conjunction with rdf datasets
moreover since rdf schema inference has a close relationship with logic rules we generalize our approach to select a custom ruleset for specifying inferences to be taken into account in a sparql query
our show that our extensions are technically feasible by providing benchmark results for rdf schema as a backend for implementing sparql with dynamic rulebased inference
rdf schema querying in our prototype system giabata
giabata which uses datalog coupled with a persistent relational database
by employing different optimization techniques like magic set rewriting our system remains competitive with stateoftheart rdf schema querying systems
