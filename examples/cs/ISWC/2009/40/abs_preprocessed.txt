the web of data is built upon two simple ideas employ the rdf data model to publish structured data on the web of data
the web of data is built upon two simple ideas employ the rdf data model to create explicit data links between entities within different data sources
the web of data presents the silk linking a toolkit for discovering data links between web data sources
the web of data presents the silk linking a toolkit for maintaining data links between web data sources
the web of data presents the silk linking framework 
silk consists of three components 
silk consists of 1
a link discovery engine 2
a link discovery engine which computes links between data sources based on a declarative specification of the conditions that entities must fulfill in order to be interlinked
a tool for evaluating the 3
the generated data links in order to finetune the linking specification
a protocol for maintaining data links between continuously changing data sources
a protocol for maintaining data links between continuously changing data sources
allows data sources to exchange both linksets
allows data sources to exchange detailed change information
enables continuous link recomputation
the interplay of all the components is demonstrated within a life science use case
