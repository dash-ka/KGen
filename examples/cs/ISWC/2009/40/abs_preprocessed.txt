The Web of Data presents the Silk Linking a toolkit for maintaining data links between Web data sources
The Web of Data presents the Silk Linking a toolkit for discovering data links between Web data sources
The Web of Data presents the Silk Linking Framework 
Silk consists of three components 
Silk consists of 1
A link discovery engine 2
A link discovery engine which computes links between data sources based on a declarative specification of the conditions that entities must fulfill in order to be interlinked
the generated data links in order to finetune the linking specification
A tool for evaluating the 3
A protocol for maintaining data links between continuously changing data sources
A protocol for maintaining data links between continuously changing data sources
enables continuous link recomputation
allows data sources to exchange both linksets
allows data sources to exchange detailed change information
The interplay of all the components is demonstrated within a life science use case
