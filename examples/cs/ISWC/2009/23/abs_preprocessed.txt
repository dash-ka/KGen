optimization of web service compositions are some of the most interesting challenges at present
formal semantic descriptions forming the  semantic web services 
since web services can be enhanced with formal semantic descriptions it becomes conceivable to exploit the quality of semantic links between services  of any composition  as one of the optimization criteria
for this we propose to use the semantic similarities between input parameters of web services
for this we propose to use the semantic similarities between output parameters of web services
coupling this with other criteria such as quality of service allow us to rank compositions achieving the same goal
coupling this with other criteria such as quality of service allow us to optimize compositions achieving the same goal
