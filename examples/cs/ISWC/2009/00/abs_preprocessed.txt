Several proposals for hybrid languages allow concepts to be simultaneously defined by rules where the ontology may also refer to predicates
Several proposals for hybrid languages allow concepts to be simultaneously defined by an ontology where rules may refer to concepts in the ontology
Several proposals for hybrid languages allow concepts to be simultaneously defined by rules where rules may refer to concepts in the ontology
predicates defined by the rules
Several proposals for hybrid languages allow concepts to be simultaneously defined by an ontology where the ontology may also refer to predicates
one such proposal for which both a stable have been defined
Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases are one such proposal
one such proposal for which both a wellfounded semantics have been defined
The definition of Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases is parametric on the ontology language in the sense that nonmonotonic rules can extend any decidable ontology language
Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases that is sound with respect to the original stable modelbased semantics
Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases that is correct with respect to the wellfounded semantics
In this paper we define a querydriven procedure for Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases
a querydriven procedure for Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases is able to answer conjunctive queries
Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases that is sound with respect to the original stable modelbased semantics
a querydriven procedure for Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases is parametric on an inference engine for reasoning in the on
a querydriven procedure for Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases is parametric on an inference engine for reasoning in tology language
Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases that is correct with respect to the wellfounded semantics
Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases that is sound with respect to the original stable modelbased semantics
a querydriven procedure for Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases is based on an extension of a and with some assumptions on the complexity of the oracle compared to the complexity of the ontology language maintains the data complexity of the wellfounded semantics for hybrid MKNF knowledge bases
Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases that is correct with respect to the wellfounded semantics as an interaction with an external oracle
Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases that is sound with respect to the original stable modelbased semantics
Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases that is correct with respect to the wellfounded semantics
a tabled rule evaluation to capture reasoning within an ontology by modeling a querydriven procedure for Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases
