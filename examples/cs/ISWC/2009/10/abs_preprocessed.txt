Module extraction methods have proved to be effective in improving the performance of some ontology reasoning tasks including finding justifications to explain why an entailment holds in an OWL DL ontology
the existing module extraction methods that compute a syntactic localitybased module for the subconcept in a subsumption entailment though ensuring the resulting module to preserve all justifications of a subsumption entailment
However the existing module extraction methods may be insufficient in improving the performance of finding all justifications
This is because a syntactic localitybased module is independent of the superconcept in a subsumption entailment
This is because a syntactic localitybased module always contains all conceptrole assertions
a module that preserves all justifications of a given entailment
In order to extract smaller modules to further optimize finding all justifications in an OWL DL ontology we propose a goaldirected method for extracting a module
a module extracted by our method
Experimental results on large ontologies show that a module is smaller than the corresponding syntactic localitybased module making the subsequent computation of all justifications more efficient
