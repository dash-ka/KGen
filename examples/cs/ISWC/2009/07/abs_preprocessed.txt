semantic annotations taken from an ontology
enriching business process models with semantic annotations has become a crucial necessity both in business processes management
enriching business process models with semantic annotations has become a crucial necessity both in integration
enriching business process models with semantic annotations has become a crucial necessity both in composition
enriching business process models with semantic annotations has become a crucial necessity both in service provisioning
an owl knowledge base that formalises a set of criteria
an owl knowledge base that formalises the business domain
an owl knowledge base that formalises the business process structure
in our work our represent semantically annotated business processes as part of an owl knowledge base describing correct semantic annotations
our show how semantic web representation can be effectively applied to formalise
diagrams that involve both knowledge about the process structure
in this paper our show sets of constraints on business process diagrams
our show how reasoning techniques can be effectively applied to formalise
our show how semantic web representation can be effectively applied to verify
our show how reasoning techniques can be effectively applied to verify
diagrams that involve both knowledge about the domain
our also present a tool for the automated transformation of an annotated business process diagram into an owl ontology
the use of the semantic web techniques presented in this paper we show how reasoning techniques can be effectively applied to verify results in a novel support for the management of business processes in the phase of process modeling
