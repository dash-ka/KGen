Scalable query answering over Description Logic plays an important role for the success of the Semantic Web
Description Logic based ontologies
Towards tackling the scalability problem we propose a decompositionbased approach to optimizing existing OWL Description Logic reasoners in evaluating conjunctive queries in OWL Description Logic ontologies
The main idea is to decompose a given OWL Description Logic ontology into a set of target ontologies without duplicated ABox axioms so that the evaluation of a given conjunctive query can be separately performed in every target ontology by applying existing OWL Description Logic reasoners
a decompositionbased approach to optimizing existing OWL Description Logic reasoners in evaluating conjunctive queries in OWL Description Logic ontologies guarantees sound results for the category of conjunctive queries that the evaluates
the applied OWL Description Logic reasoner correctly
a decompositionbased approach to optimizing existing OWL Description Logic reasoners in evaluating conjunctive queries in OWL Description Logic ontologies guarantees complete results for the category of conjunctive queries that the evaluates
