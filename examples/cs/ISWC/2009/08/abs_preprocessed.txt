Ontology Modularization techniques identify often reusable regions within an ontology
Ontology Modularization techniques identify coherent regions within an ontology
The ability to identify such modules thus potentially reducing the size or complexity of an ontology for a given task is increasingly important in the Semantic Web as domain ontologies increase in terms of expressivity
The ability to identify such modules thus potentially reducing the size or complexity of an ontology for set of concepts is increasingly important in the Semantic Web as domain ontologies increase in terms of size

To date many techniques have been developed
evaluation of the results of many techniques is sketchy and somewhat ad hoc
Theoretical properties of modularization algorithms have only been studied in a small number of cases
the modules they identify over a number of diverse ontologies by utilizing objective taskoriented measures to evaluate the fitness of the modules for a number of statistical classification problems identify over a number of diverse ontologies by utilizing objective taskoriented measures to evaluate the fitness of the modules for a number of statistical classification problems
This paper presents an empirical analysis of the modules a number of modularization techniques
