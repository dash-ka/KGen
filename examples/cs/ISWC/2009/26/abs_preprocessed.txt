an important application of semantic web technology is recognizing humandefined concepts in text
facilities that let users specify
facilities that let users reformulate users queries
facilities that let users complete
query transformation is a strategy often used in search engines to derive queries
queries that are able to return more useful search results than the original query provide facilities
queries that are able to return more useful search results than most popular search engines provide facilities
we study the problem of a special type of query transformation based on identifying semantic concepts
we study the problem of semantic query suggestion based on identifying semantic concepts
semantic concepts contained in user queries
we use a featurebased approach in conjunction with supervised machine learning augmenting termbased features with conceptspecific features
we use a featurebased approach in conjunction with supervised machine learning augmenting termbased features with search historybased
we apply we method to the task of linking queries from realworld query logs  to the dbpedia knowledge base
we apply we method to the task of linking queries from the transaction logs of the netherlands institute for vision  to the dbpedia knowledge base
we apply we method to the task of linking queries from the transaction logs of the netherlands institute for sound  to the dbpedia knowledge base
we show significant improvements over an already high baseline
we evaluate the utility of different machine learning feature types in identifying semantic concepts using a manually developed test bed
