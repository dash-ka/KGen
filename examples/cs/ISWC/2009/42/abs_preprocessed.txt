the rdfs closure that are often ignored such as literal generalization
the rdfs closure that are often ignored such as container membership properties
in this paper we consider the problem of materializing the complete finite rdfs closure in a scalable manner this includes those parts of the rdfs closure
128 cores using differentsize subsets of the lubm 10000university data
we point out characteristics of rdfs
rdfs that allow we to derive an embarrassingly parallel algorithm for producing said closure
we evaluate we cmpi implementation of the algorithm on a cluster with 128 cores
the lubm 10000university data set
we show that the time to produce inferences scales linearly with the number of processes evaluating this behavior on up to hundreds of millions of triples
inferences produced for different subsets of lubm10k
we also show the number of inferences
to the best of we knowledge we work is the first to provide rdfs inferencing on such large data sets in such low times
finally we discuss future work in terms of promising applications of this approach
massive scaling on supercomputers
finally we discuss future work in terms of promising applications of
