Ontology matching plays a key role for semantic interoperability
Many methods have been proposed for automatically finding the alignment between heterogeneous ontologies
However in many realworld applications finding the alignment in a completely automatic way is highly infeasible
Ideally an ontology matching system would have an interactive interface to allow users to provide feedbacks to guide the automatic algorithm
Fundamentally we need answer the following questions How can a system perform an efficiently interactive process with The users
How many interactions are sufficient for finding a more accurate matching
To address the following questions we propose an active learning framework for ontology matching matches to query The users
ontology matching which tries to find the most informative candidate
The users feedbacks are used to 1  correct the mistake matching and 2  propagate the supervise information to help the entire matching process
Three measures are proposed to estimate the confidence of each matching candidate
A correct propagation algorithm is further
further proposed to maximize the spread of the users  guidance 
Experimental results on several public data sets show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the matching accuracy  80
