scalable distributed reasoning proposing a technique for materialising the closure of an rdf graph based on mapreduce
we address the problem of scalable distributed reasoning
we have implemented we approach on top of hadoop
we have deployed hadoop on a compute cluster of up to 64 commodity machines
we show that we present several nontrivial optimisations
we show that a naive implementation on top of mapreduce is straightforward
we show that a naive implementation on top of mapreduce performs badly
we algorithm is scalable
we algorithm allows us to compute the rdfs closure of 865m triples from the web  producing 30b triples  in less than two hours faster than any other published approach
