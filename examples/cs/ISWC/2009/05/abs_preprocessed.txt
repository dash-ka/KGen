Ontologies are tools for structuring knowledge with many applications in searching complex knowledge bases
Since building many applications in analyzing complex knowledge bases manually is a costly process there are various approaches for bootstrapping ontologies automatically through the analysis of appropriate documents

Such an analysis needs to find the relationships
the relationships that should form the ontology
Such an analysis needs to find the concepts
However since relationship extraction methods are imprecise the initial set of relationships is usually inconsistent a problem which to the best of our knowledge was mostly ignored so far
However since relationship extraction methods can not homogeneously cover all concepts the initial set of relationships is rather imbalanced a problem which to the best of our knowledge was mostly ignored so far

In this paper our define the problem of extracting a consistent as well as properly structured ontology from a set of heterogeneous relationships
In this paper our define the problem of extracting a consistent as well as properly structured ontology from a set of inconsistent relationships
Moreover we compare three graphbased methods for solving the ontology extraction problem
Moreover we propose three graphbased methods for solving the ontology extraction problem
a gold standard ontology comprising more than 12K relationships
our extract relationships from a largescale data set of more than 325K documents
our extract relationships from evaluate our methods against a gold standard ontology
an algorithm based on a modified formulation of the dominating set problem
our study shows that an algorithm outperforms greedy methods
