areas that rely upon everyday users to create knowledge bases
debugging is an important prerequisite for the widespread application of ontologies especially in areas such as the semantic web
areas that rely upon everyday users to maintain knowledge bases
most recent approaches use diagnosis methods to identify sources of inconsistency
however in most debugging cases these methods return many alternative diagnoses thus placing the burden of fault localization on the user
the user demonstrates how the target diagnosis can be identified by performing a sequence of observations that is by querying an oracle about entailments of the target ontology
we exploit probabilities of typical user errors to formulate information theoretic concepts for query selection
we evaluation showed that the suggested method reduces the number of required observations compared to myopic strategies
