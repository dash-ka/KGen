there are ontology domain concepts
ontology domain concepts that can be represented according to multiple alternative classification criteria
current ontology modeling guidelines do not explicitly consider this aspect in the representation of such concepts
facet analysis used in library science
to assist with this issue we examined a domainspecific simplified model for facet analysis
a faceted classification scheme which accounts for the multiple alternative classification criteria of the domain concept under scrutiny
a domainspecific simplified model for facet analysis produces a faceted classification scheme
facet analysis used in library science
a comparative analysis between a comparative analysis between a fcs  indicates the existence of key similarities between the elements in the generic structure of both knowledge representation models
a comparative analysis between a comparative analysis between the normalisation ontology design pattern  indicates the existence of key similarities between the elements in the generic structure of both knowledge representation models
a comparative analysis between a a faceted classification scheme and the normalisation ontology design pattern  indicates the existence of key similarities between the elements in the generic structure of both knowledge representation models
a a faceted classification scheme into an owl dl ontology applying the normalisation a comparative analysis between the normalisation ontology design pattern
a a faceted classification scheme into an owl dl ontology applying the normalisation a comparative analysis between a fcs
as a result a mapping is identified that allows to transform a a faceted classification scheme into an owl dl ontology
our contribution is illustrated with an existing a faceted classification scheme example in the domain of  dishwashing detergent  that benefits from the outcome of this study
