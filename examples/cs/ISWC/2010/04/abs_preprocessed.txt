biomedical ontologies provide fresh motivations for extending a topic
semantic web policy languages  provide fresh motivations for extending dls with nonmonotonic inferences
despite this nonmonotonic inferences are not yet supported by the existing dl engines
one reason is the high computational complexity of the existing decidable fragments of nonmonotonic dls
in this paper we identify a fragment of circumscribed el ot
circumscribed el ot that supports attribute inheritance with much like an objectoriented language  that reasoning about default attributes is in p
circumscribed el ot that supports attribute inheritance with specificitybased overriding  that reasoning about default attributes is in p
circumscribed el ot that supports attribute inheritance with such that reasoning about default attributes is in p
