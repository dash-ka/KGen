Such measurements are stored in tables in eg research reports
Such measurements are stored in tables in eg spreadsheet files
To reuse such data it is necessary to have a semantic description of the data
To integrate such data it is necessary to have a semantic description of the data
However the notation is often ambiguous making automatic interpretation and conversion to other suitable format difficult
the notation used
However the notation is often ambiguous making automatic interpretation and conversion to RDF difficult
For example the table header cell  f  Hz   refers to frequency measured in Hertz
For example the table header cell  f  Hz   refers to frequency the symbol  f  can also refer to luminous flux
For example the table header cell  f  Hz   refers to frequency the symbol  f  can also refer to the quantities force
For example the table header cell  f  Hz   refers to frequency the symbol  f  can also refer to the unit farad
Current annotation tools for this task either work on less ambiguous data
Current annotation tools for this task perform a more limited task
an ontology which allows to improve performance on  sloppy  datasets not yet targeted by existing systems
We introduce new disambiguation strategies based on an ontology
