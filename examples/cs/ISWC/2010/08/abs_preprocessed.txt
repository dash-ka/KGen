Measuring similarity between ontologies can be very useful for different purposes
an ontology in which queries can be translated
finding an ontology to replace another
finding an ontology
Classical measures compute similarities in an ontology space by directly comparing the content of ontologies
Classical measures compute distances in an ontology space by directly comparing the content of ontologies
ontology measures computed in an alignment space
ontology measures computed in an alignment space a new family of ontology measures evaluate the similarity between two ontologies with regard to the available alignments between a new family of ontology measures
We introduce a new family of ontology measures
ontology measures computed in an alignment space
such measures relying on the existence of a path between ontologies
We define two sets of such measures
the ontology entities that are preserved by the alignments
such measures relying on the ontology entities
The former accounts for known relations between ontologies while the latter reflects the possibility to perform actions such as query translation
The former accounts for known relations between ontologies while the latter reflects the possibility to perform actions such as instance import
the OntoSim library that has been used in experiments
entity preserving measures
experiments which showed that entity are comparable to the best ontology space measures
All these measures have been implemented in the OntoSim library
Moreover All these measures showed a robust behaviour with respect to the alteration of the alignment space
