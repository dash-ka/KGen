we extend the semantic web query language sparql by defining the semantics of sparql queries under the entailment regimes of owl
we extend the semantic web query language sparql by defining the semantics of sparql queries under the entailment regimes of rdfs
the proposed extensions are part of the sparql 11 entailment regimes working draft
draft which is currently being developed as part of the w3c standardization process of sparql 11
we review the conditions that sparql imposes on such extensions discuss the practical difficulties of this task
we explicate the design choices underlying we proposals
in addition we include current implementations
current implementations underlying techniques
in addition we include an overview of current implementations
