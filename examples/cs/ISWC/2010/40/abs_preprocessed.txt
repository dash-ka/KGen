Facilitating the seamless evolution of RDF knowledge bases on the Semantic Web presents still a major challenge
In this work we devise EvoPat a patternbased approach for the evolution and refactoring of knowledge bases
The approach is based on the definition of basic evolution patterns
basic evolution patterns which can capture simple evolution on both data
basic evolution patterns which can capture simple evolution on both schema levels
basic evolution patterns which are represented declaratively
basic evolution patterns which can capture refactoring operations on both data
basic evolution patterns which can capture refactoring operations on both schema levels
For domainspecific evolution several simple evolution patterns can be combined into a compound one
For refactorings several simple evolution patterns can be combined into a compound one
For more advanced several simple evolution patterns can be combined into a compound one
We performed a comprehensive survey of possible evolution patterns with a combinatorial analysis of all possible beforeafter combinations resulting in an extensive catalog of usable evolution patterns
We approach was implemented as an extension for framework
We approach was implemented as an extension for the OntoWiki semantic collaboration platform
