information  which constitutes a valuable source of semantics
While in the past the unavailability of complete semantic descriptions constituted a serious limitation of the unavailability of rich and complete semantic descriptions applicability nowadays the Semantic Web encoded information 
eg ontologies RDF data  which constitutes a valuable source of semantics
the Semantic Web made available a large amount of logically

eg ontologies RDF data linked data
However web semantics can not be easily plugged into machine learning systems
Therefore the objective of this paper is to define a reference methodology for combining semantic information available in the web under the form of logical theories with statistical methods for NLP
The major problems that we have to solve to implement we methodology concern the selection of the correct knowledge among the large amount available in the web the representation of uncertain knowledge and the resolution of the rules retrieved from Semantic Web sources with semantics in the text
The major problems that we have to solve to implement we methodology concern the selection of the minimal knowledge among the large amount available in the web the representation of uncertain knowledge and the encoding of the rules retrieved from Semantic Web sources with semantics in the text

In order to evaluate our present an application of the methodology to the problem of intradocument coreference resolution
In order to evaluate our show by means of some experiments on the standard dataset
In order to evaluate the appropriateness of our approach
the standard dataset how the injection of knowledge leads to the improvement of this task performance
