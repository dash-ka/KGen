the ontology underlying the source dataset in the Linked Data cloud
Building applications over Linked Data often requires a mapping between the application model
Building applications over Linked Data often requires the ontology
the ontology underlying the source dataset in the Linked Data cloud
a mapping between the application model can be defined in many ways
a mapping between the ontology can be defined in many ways
For instance by describing the application model as a view over the source dataset by giving mappings in the form of dependencies between the two datasets that infer the application model from the source dataset
For instance by inference rules that infer the application model from the source dataset
Explicitly formulating these mappings demands a comprehensive understanding of the underlying schemas  of the target datasets
Explicitly formulating these mappings demands a comprehensive understanding of RDF ontologies  of the target datasets
Explicitly formulating these mappings demands a comprehensive understanding of the underlying schemas  of the source datasets
Explicitly formulating these mappings demands a comprehensive understanding of RDF ontologies  of the source datasets
This task can help the application designer with finding the implicit relationships that the application designer wants to map
This task can be supported by integrating the process of schema exploration into the mapping process
This paper describes Fusion a framework for closing the underlying ontologies in the Linked Data cloud
This paper describes Fusion a framework for closing the gap between the application model
Fusion simplifies the definition of mappings by providing a visual user interface
a visual user interface that integrates the mapping process
a visual user interface that integrates the exploratory process
the mapping process architecture allows the creation of new applications through the extension of existing Linked Data with additional data
