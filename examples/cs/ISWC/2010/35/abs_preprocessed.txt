many applications make use of named entity classification
many named entity classification methods where the choice of features is critical to final performance
the preferred technique adopted for many named entity classification methods
machine learning is the preferred technique
existing approaches explore only the features the named entity linguistic context
only the features derived from the characteristic of the named entity
existing approaches explore only the features the named entity linguistic context
with the development of the semantic web a large number of data sources are published across the web as linked open data
with the development of the semantic web a large number of data sources are connected across the web as linked open data
knowledge that can be a valuable asset when used in connection with named entity classification
linked open data provides rich a priori knowledge about entity type information knowledge
in this paper we explore the use of linked open data to enhance named entity classification
we builds pair
we method extracts information from linked open data
a type knowledge base which is used to score a
we builds a type knowledge base  named entity string type 
this score is then injected as one features into the existing classifier in order to improve this score performance
this score is then injected as more features into the existing classifier in order to improve this score performance
the results which confirm the effectiveness of we proposed method
we report the results
we conducted a thorough experimental study
