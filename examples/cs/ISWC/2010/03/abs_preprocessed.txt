blogging platforms remain primarily limited to text
several projects have brought rich data semantics to collaborative wikis
as blogs comprise a significant portion of the semantic web content engagement of the blogging community is crucial to the development of the semantic web
we provide a study of blog content to show a latent need for better data publishing in blogging software
we provide a study of blog content to show visualization support in blogging software
we then present datapress an extension to the wordpress blogging platform
the wordpress blogging platform that enables users to publish share aggregate and visualize structured information using the same workflow that users already apply to textbased content
in particular we aim to preserve those attributes
those attributes that make blogs such a successful publication medium from other sources
those attributes that make easy copy and paste of information  and visualizations  from other sources
those attributes that make oneclick publishing of the information from other sources
those attributes that make oneclick access to the information from other sources
those attributes that make oneclick publishing of natural authoring interfaces from other sources
we reflect on how we designs make progress toward these goals with a study of how users made use of various features
