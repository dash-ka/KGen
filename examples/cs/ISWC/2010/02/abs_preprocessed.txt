analysing the performance of owl reasoners on expressive owl ontologies is an ongoing challenge
in this paper we present a new approach to performance analysis
performance analysis based on justifications for entailments of owl ontologies
justifications are minimal subsets of an ontology
an ontology that are commonly used to debug owl ontologies
an ontology that are sufficient for an entailment to hold
test which means that individual justifications are tested for reasoner performance instead of random subsets
test which means that individual justifications are tested for reasoner performance instead of entire ontologies
test which means that individual justifications are tested for correctness performance instead of entire ontologies
in justbench justifications form the key unit of test
test which means that individual justifications are tested for correctness performance instead of random subsets
justifications are generally small which makes justifications very suitable for transparent analytic microbenchmarks
justifications are relatively easy to analyse which makes justifications very suitable for transparent analytic microbenchmarks
furthermore the justbench approach also allows us to isolate reasoner errors
furthermore the justbench approach also allows us to isolate inconsistent behaviour
us present the results of initial experiments
the results of initial experiments using justbench with fact
the results of initial experiments using justbench with pellet
the results of initial experiments using justbench with hermit
finally us show how justbench can be used by reasoner developers
