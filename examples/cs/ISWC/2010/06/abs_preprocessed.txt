The availability of streaming data sources is progressively increasing thanks to the development of ubiquitous data capturing technologies such as sensor networks
The heterogeneity of streaming data sources introduces the requirement of providing data access in a unified manner whilst allowing the user to express streaming data sources needs at an ontological level
The heterogeneity of streaming data sources introduces the requirement of providing data access in a coherent manner whilst allowing the user to express streaming data sources needs at an ontological level
In this paper we describe an ontologybased streaming data access service
Sources link Sources data content to ontologies through s 2o mappings
the ontology using sparql Stream
Users can query the ontology
the ontology using an extension of sparql for streaming data
A preliminary implementation of the approach is also presented
With A preliminary implementation of the approach we expect to set the basis for future efforts in ontologybased streaming data integration
