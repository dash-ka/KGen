the web of data is increasingly becoming an important infrastructure for such diverse sectors as government

the web of data is increasingly becoming an important infrastructure for such diverse sectors as ecommerce
as a result the robustness of the web of data is now crucial
prior studies show that the web of data is strongly dependent on a small number of central hubs making the web of data highly vulnerable to single points of failure
in this paper we present concepts to analyse the brittleness of the web of data
in this paper we present algorithms to analyse the brittleness of the web of data
in this paper we present algorithms to repair the brittleness of the web of data
in this paper we present concepts to repair the brittleness of the web of data
we apply these on a substantial subset of it the 2010 billion triple challenge dataset
we first distinguish the physical structure of the web of data from the web of data semantic structure
for both of these structures we then calculate both of these structures robustness
both of these structures robustness taking betweenness centrality as a robustnessmeasure
to the best of we knowledge this is the first time that such robustnessindicators have been calculated for the web of data
finally we determine which links should be added to the web of data in order to improve the web of data robustness most effectively
we are able to determine such links by deploying an evolutionary algorithm to solve a very large optimisation problem
we are able to determine such links by interpreting the question as a very large optimisation problem
we believe that with this work we offer an effective method to analyse the most important structure that the the web of data community has constructed to date
