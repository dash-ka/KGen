situations in which usage of certain entities enable the automatic evaluation whether a situation is compliant
situations in which usage of certain entities are allowed
formal policies allow the nonambiguous definition of situations
this is useful for example in applications using data provided via standardized interfaces
the low technical barriers of integrating such data sources is in contrast to the manual evaluation of natural language policies as natural language policies currently exist
policies which can be restricted by the policy of a used entity
usage situations can usage situations be regulated by policies
applications using the google maps api
consider for example the google maps api
the google maps api which requires that applications must be available without a fee ie the applications policy must not require a payment
a policy language that can express such constraints on other policies ie a selfpolicing policy language
in this paper we present a policy language
we validate we approach by realizing a use case scenario using a policy engine developed for our language
