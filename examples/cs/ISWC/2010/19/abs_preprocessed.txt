In Linked Data the use of owl is ubiquitous in interlinking datasets
In Linked Data the use of sameAs is ubiquitous in interlinking datasets
There is however ongoing discussion about owl sameAs use
There is however ongoing discussion about owl potential misuse particularly with regards to interactions with inference
In fact sameAs can be viewed as encoding only one point on a scale of one 
In fact sameAs can be viewed as encoding only one point on a scale of sameAs current uses
In fact owl can be viewed as encoding only one point on a scale of one 
one that is often too strong for many of owl
In fact owl can be viewed as encoding only one point on a scale of sameAs current uses
In fact sameAs can be viewed as encoding only one point on a scale of similarity 
In fact owl can be viewed as encoding only one point on a scale of similarity 
We describe how referentially opaque contexts exist
referentially opaque contexts that do not allow inference
outline some varieties of referentiallyopaque alternatives to owl
outline sameAs
Finally We report on an empirical experiment over sameAs statements from the Web of data
Finally We report on an empirical experiment over randomly selected owl 
experiment she would light upon how owl is being used  and misused  on the Web of data
