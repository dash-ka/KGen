AnQL that is inspired by SPARQL
Starting from the general framework for Annotated RDFS which we presented in previous work  extending Udrea et als Annotated RDF  we address the development of a query language AnQL that is inspired by SPARQL

several features of SPARQL 11
formal definitions of the semantics of subqueries aggregates assignment solution modifiers  which could serve as a basis for the ongoing work in SPARQL 11
formal definitions of the semantics of these features  which could serve as a basis for the ongoing work in SPARQL 11
As a side effect we propose formal definitions of the semantics of subqueries aggregates assignment solution modifiers 
As a side effect we propose formal definitions of the semantics of these features 
We demonstrate the value of such a framework by comparing We approach to previously proposed extensions of SPARQL
We demonstrate the value of such a framework by comparing We show that AnQL generalises and extends them
