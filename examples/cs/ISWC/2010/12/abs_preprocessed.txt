Increasingly huge RDF data sets are being published on the Web
Currently the Web contain high levels of redundancy
Currently the Web have a plain indivisible structure
Currently the Web use different syntaxes of RDF
All this leads to lack of scalability
All this leads to fuzzy publications
All this leads to inefficient management
All this leads to complex processing
a novel RDF representation which takes advantage of the structural properties of RDF graphs for splitting efficiently three components of RDF data Dictionary structure
a novel RDF representation which takes advantage of the structural properties of RDF graphs representing efficiently three components of RDF data Header structure
All this presents a novel RDF representation
a novel RDF representation which takes advantage of the structural properties of RDF graphs representing efficiently three components of RDF data Triples structure

Ondemand management operations can be implemented on top of a novel RDF representation representation
more than fifteen times the current naive representation improving parsing while keeping a consistent publication scheme
Experiments show that data sets can be compacted in a novel RDF representation by more than fifteen times the current naive representation
more than fifteen times the current naive representation improving processing while keeping a consistent publication scheme
For exchanging specific compression techniques over a novel RDF representation improve current compression solutions
