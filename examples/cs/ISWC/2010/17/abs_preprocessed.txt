Ontologies are often collaboratively developed
Ontologies are used for sharing information
Ontologies are adapted for different applications and domains
an ontology that are caused by refactorings
an ontology that are caused by changes
different applications and domains resulting in multiple versions of an ontology
Quite often ontology versions  are syntactical very different
Quite often or parts of Ontologies  are semantically equivalent
Quite often ontology versions  are semantically equivalent
Quite often or parts of Ontologies  are syntactical very different
While there is existing work on detecting structural changes in ontologies there is still a need in analyzing ontology changes and refactorings by a semantically comparison of ontology versions

In our approach our start with a classification of model refactorings found in software engineering for identifying such refactorings in OWL ontologies
OWL ontologies using DL reasoning to recognize such refactorings
