owl 2 currently support only static ontologies
rdf  currently support only static ontologies
such rdf  currently support only static ontologies
semantic web applications often need to represent such changes and reason about semantic web applications
in practice
however the truth of statements often changes with time
in this paper we present a logicbased approach for representing validity time in rdf
in this paper we present a logicbased approach for representing validity time in owl
unlike the existing proposals we approach is applicable to entailment relations such as the rdfbased semantics of owl 2
unlike the existing proposals we approach is applicable to entailment relations such as the direct semantics
entailment relations that are not deterministic
we also present a query evaluation algorithm
we also extend sparql to temporal rdf graphs
entailment relations characterized by a set of such rdf
entailment relations characterized by a set of deterministic rules
we algorithm that is applicable to entailment relations
finally we present an optimization of we algorithm
entailment relations characterized by a set of owl 2 rlrdf entailment
