recently processing of queries on linked data has gained attention
a mixed strategy that assumes some incomplete knowledge
a mixed strategy that discovers new sources at runtime
a topdown strategy that relies on complete knowledge about new sources to select relevant sources
a bottomup strategy that discovers new sources during query processing by following links between sources
we systematically discuss three main strategies a mixed strategy
we systematically discuss three main strategies a topdown strategy
we identify
we systematically discuss three main strategies a bottomup strategy
a topdown strategy that relies on complete knowledge about new sources to process relevant sources
knowledge discovered at runtime
to exploit knowledge we propose an additional step explicitly scheduled during query processing called correct source ranking
additionally we propose the adoption of streambased query processing to deal with the unpredictable nature of data access in the distributed linked data environment
in experiments we show that our implementation of the mixed strategy leads to early reporting of results and thus more responsive query processing while not requiring complete knowledge
