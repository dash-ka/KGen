In this paper we discuss optimisations of rulebased materialisation approaches for reasoning over large static RDF datasets
We generalise what We call the  partialindexing  approach to the  partialindexing  approach to scalable rulebased materialisation is based on a separation of terminological data which has been shown in previous works to enable highly scalable in so doing We provide some completeness propositions with respect to seminaive evaluation
We reformalise what We call the  partialindexing  approach to scalable rulebased materialisation is based on a separation of terminological data which has been shown in previous works to enable highly scalable in so doing We provide some completeness propositions with respect to seminaive evaluation

We then show how related work on template rules TBoxspecific dynamic rulesets can be incorporated for the partialindexing approach
We then show how related work on template rules TBoxspecific dynamic rulesets can be optimised for the partialindexing approach
TBoxspecific dynamic rulesets created by binding the terminological patterns in the static ruleset
methods using pD 
methods using OWL Horst 
We evaluate We methods
methods using OWL 2 RL
methods using LUBM for RDFS
thereafter demonstrate pragmatic distributed reasoning over 112 billion Linked Data statements for a subset of OWL 2 RLRDF rules we argue to be suitable for Web reasoning
