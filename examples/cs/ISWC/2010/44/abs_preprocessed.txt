Recent research on automated Web Service Composition has argued convincingly for the importance of optimizing quality of user preferences
While some of this optimization can be done offline many useful optimizations must be done following execution of at least some informationgathering services
While some of this optimization can be done offline many interesting optimizations are datadependent
