principled techniques that exploit user feedback to customize the alignment process for a given pair of ontologies
In this paper we present a set of principled techniques
Specifically we propose an iterative supervisedlearning approach to use the weights
the weights assigned to each alignment strategy
the weights assigned to each alignment strategy to determine the degree to which the information from such matches should be propagated to such matches neighbors along different relationships for collective matching
Specifically we propose an iterative supervisedlearning approach to determine the weights
the weights assigned to each alignment strategy to combine each alignment strategy for matching ontology entities
We demonstrate the utility of these techniques with large realworld ontologies showing improvements in Fscores of up to 70
We demonstrate the utility of these techniques with standard benchmark datasets showing improvements in Fscores of up to 70
