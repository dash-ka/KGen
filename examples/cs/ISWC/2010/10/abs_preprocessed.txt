the vocabulary used
Effective communication in open environments relies on the ability of agents to reach a mutual understanding of the exchanged message by reconciling the vocabulary
Various approaches have considered how mutually acceptable mappings between corresponding concepts in the agents own ontologies may be determined dynamically through argumentationbased negotiation  such as Meaningbased Argumentation MbA 
In this paper we present a novel approach to the dynamic determination of mutually acceptable mappings prefer
mutually acceptable mappings that allows agents to express a private acceptability threshold over the types of mappings agents
We empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach produces larger agreed alignments thus better enabling agent communication
We empirically compare this approach with the Meaningbased Argumentation
Furthermore
we empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach has comparable performance to the MbA approach
we evaluate the fitness for purpose of the generated alignments
