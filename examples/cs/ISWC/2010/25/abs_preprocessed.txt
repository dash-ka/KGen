the web of data currently coming into existence through the linked open data effort is a major milestone in realizing the the web of data currently coming into existence through the linked open data rrb effort vision
applications based on linked open data
however the development of applications faces difficulties due to the fact that the different linked open data datasets are rather loosely connected pieces of information
in particular
schemalevel information is being ignored
links between linked open data datasets are almost exclusively on the level of instances
in this paper we therefore present a system for finding schemalevel links between linked open data datasets in the sense of ontology alignment
our system called blooms
our system is based on the idea of bootstrapping information already present on the linked open data cloud
our also present a comprehensive evaluation
present a comprehensive evaluation which shows that blooms outperforms stateoftheart ontology alignment systems on linked open data datasets
at the same time blooms is also competitive compared with these other systems on the ontology evaluation alignment initiative benchmark datasets
