different sources using equivalence statements such as other types of linked properties
the web of linked data is characterized by linking structured data from different sources
different sources using equivalence statements such as sameas
the ontologies behind different sources however remain unlinked

this paper describes an extensional approach to generate alignments between the ontologies behind these sources
specifically our algorithm produces subsumption relationships between classes from ontologies of different linked data sources by exploring the space of hypotheses
specifically our algorithm produces equivalence relationships between classes from ontologies of different linked data sources by exploring the space of hypotheses
hypotheses supported by the existing equivalence statements
we are also able to generate new classes for a second source where the ontology is not as refined as the first
we are also able to generate a complementary hierarchy of derived classes within an existing ontology where the ontology is not as refined as the first
we demonstrate empirically we approach using linked data sources from the geospatial
we demonstrate empirically we approach using linked data sources from genetics
we demonstrate empirically we approach using linked data sources from zoology domains
our algorithm discovered about 29000 subset relationships in the alignment of five source pairs from these domains
our algorithm discovered about 800 equivalences in the alignment of five source pairs from these domains
thus we are able to understand the semantic relationships between the two sources
thus we are able to model one linked data source in terms of another by aligning linked data ontologies
