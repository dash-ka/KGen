services that can be created from online sources by using scalable approaches to solve the service selection problem
services that can be created from online sources by using existing annotation tools widely available to the users
given the large number of semantic web services are required to make the large number of semantic web services
services that can be created from online sources by using efficient approaches to solve the service selection problem
services that can be created from online sources by using existing annotation tools
services that can be created from online sources by using expressive formalisms
a framework that is grounded on the localasview approach for representing instances of the service selection problem
in this paper we propose a framework
a framework that is grounded on logic for representing instances of the service selection problem
in we approach web services are semantically described using lav mappings in terms of generic concepts from an ontology
user requests correspond to conjunctive queries on the generic concepts
 in addition the user may specify a set of preferences
preferences that are used to rank the possible solutions to the given request
the ranks induced by the preferences
a query rewriting problem that must consider the relationships among the ranks
a query rewriting problem that must consider the relationships among the concepts in the ontology
the lav formulation allows us to cast the service selection problem as a query rewriting problem
then building on related work we devise an encoding of the resulting query rewriting problem as a logical theory whose models are in correspondence with the solutions of the user request
preferences whose best models are in correspondence with the bestranked solutions
then building on related work we devise an encoding of the resulting query rewriting problem as a logical theory whose models are in correspondence in presence of preferences
thus by exploiting known properties of modern sat solvers we provide an efficient solution to the service selection problem
thus by exploiting known properties of modern sat solvers we provide an scalable solution to the service selection problem
the approach provides the basis to represent a large number of realworld situations
the approach provides the basis to represent a large number of interesting user requests
