Knowledge Bases expressed in Lite family
Knowledge Bases expressed in Description Logics of the Description Logic
We study the problem of evolution for Knowledge Bases
Description Logic Lite is at the basis of OWL 2 QL one of the tractable fragments of OWL 2 
Description Logic Lite is at the basis of OWL 2 QL one of the tractable fragments of the recently proposed revision of the Web Ontology Language
We propose some fundamental principles that Knowledge Base evolution should respect
We review known model for evolution of propositional theories
We review formulabased approaches for evolution of propositional theories
We exhibit limitations of a number of modelbased approaches besides the fact that a number of modelbased approaches are either not expressible in Lite a number of modelbased approaches intrinsically ignore the structural properties of Knowledge Bases
Knowledge Bases resulting from such an evolution
Knowledge Bases which leads to undesired properties of Knowledge Bases
We exhibit limitations of a number of modelbased approaches besides the fact that a number of modelbased approaches are either not expressible in Description Logic a number of modelbased approaches intrinsically ignore the structural properties of Knowledge Bases
We exhibit limitations of a number of modelbased approaches besides the fact that a number of modelbased approaches are either hard to compute a number of modelbased approaches intrinsically ignore the structural properties of Knowledge Bases
We also examine proposals on revision of Description Logic Knowledge Bases
Description Logic Knowledge Bases that adopt the modelbased approaches
We also examine proposals on update
Description Logic Knowledge Bases that discuss the modelbased approaches drawbacks
We show because the result of such an action of evolution is not expressible in Description Logic
We show that known formulabased approaches are also not appropriate for Description Logic
We show because the result of such an action of evolution is not expressible in Lite
We show that known formulabased approaches are also not appropriate for Lite evolution
We show that known formulabased approaches are also due to high complexity of computation
Building upon the insights gained we propose two novel formulabased approaches that respect we principles
Building upon the insights gained we propose two novel formulabased approaches for which evolution is Lite
Building upon the insights gained we propose two novel formulabased approaches for which evolution is expressible in Description Logic
For we approaches we also developed polynomial time algorithms to compute evolution of Description Logic 
For we approaches we also developed polynomial time algorithms to compute Lite Knowledge Bases
