On the Semantic Web decision makers  humans alike  are faced with the challenge of examining large volumes of information
information originating from heterogeneous sources with the goal of ascertaining trust in various pieces of information

While previous work has focused on simple models for rating systems we introduce a new trust model for uncertain informationWe present the challenges raised by the new model and the results of an evaluation of the first prototype implementation under a variety of scenarios
While previous work has focused on simple models for review systems we introduce a new trust model for rich informationWe present the challenges raised by the new model and the results of an evaluation of the first prototype implementation under a variety of scenarios
