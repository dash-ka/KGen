We study the problem of SPARQL query optimization on top of distributed hash tables
Existing works thus exhibit poor performance
Existing works on SPARQL query processing in such environments have never been do not utilize any optimization techniques
Existing works on SPARQL query processing in such environments have never been implemented in a real system
We goal in this paper is to propose scalable algorithms for optimizing SPARQL basic graph pattern queries
We goal in this paper is to propose efficient algorithms for optimizing SPARQL basic graph pattern queries
query optimization strategies that improve performance in terms of query response time
query optimization strategies that improve performance in terms of bandwidth usage
We augment a known distributed query processing algorithm with query optimization strategies
We implement We study We performance experimentally in a local cluster
We implement We techniques in the system Atlas experimentally in a local cluster
