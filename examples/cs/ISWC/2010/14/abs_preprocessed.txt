Ontology classification the computation of subsumption hierarchies for classes  is one of the most important tasks for OWL reasoners
Ontology classification the computation of subsumption hierarchies for properties  is one of the most important tasks for OWL reasoners
Based on the algorithm by Horrocks we present a new classification procedure that addresses several open issues of the original algorithm
Based on the algorithm by Shearer we present a new classification procedure that uses several novel optimisations in order to achieve superior performance

Based on the algorithm by Shearer we present a new classification procedure that addresses several open issues of the original algorithm
we also consider the classification of properties
we show that algorithms commonly used to implement that task are incomplete even for relatively weak ontology languages
a standard classification problem which allows reasoners to classify properties using we optimised procedure
Furthermore we show how to reduce the property classification problem into a standard classification problem
we present the results of a performance evaluation
we implemented we algorithms in the OWL HermiT reasoner
