sources using a term index
In order to quickly answer queries in environments with distributed RDFOWL we present a query optimization algorithm to identify the potentially relevant Semantic Web data sources
In order to effectively answer queries in environments with distributed RDFOWL we present a query optimization algorithm to identify the potentially relevant Semantic Web data sources
sources using structural query features
a query optimization algorithm is based on the observation that the join selectivity of a pair of query triple patterns is often higher than the overall selectivity of these two patterns
these two patterns treated independently
Given a rule goal tree a query optimization algorithm uses a bottomup approach to estimate the selectivity of each node
a rule goal tree that expresses the reformulation of a conjunctive query
a query optimization algorithm then prioritizes loading of selective nodes and uses the information from these sources to further constrain other nodes
Finally
the selected sources
we use an OWL reasoner to answer queries over the selected sources
the selected sources corresponding ontologies
