We combine regular path queries with query approximation in order to support flexible querying of RDF data where its full structure is irregular
We combine regular path queries with query approximation in order to support flexible querying of RDF data when the users lacks knowledge of the users full structure
We develop query relaxation techniques for regular path queries
In such circumstances it is helpful if the querying system can perform both approximate matching and relaxation of the users query and can rank the answers according to how closely the users match the original query
Our framework incorporates both standard notions of approximation
approximation based on edit distance
approximation based on RDFSbased inference rules
extensions proposed for SPARQL to allow for querying paths
querying paths using regular expressions
The query language we adopt comprises conjunctions of regular path queries thus including extensions
an incremental query evaluation algorithm which runs in returns answers to the users in ranked order
We provide an incremental query evaluation algorithm
an incremental query evaluation algorithm which runs in polynomial time to the users in ranked order
