The proliferation of linked data on the Web paves the way to a new generation of applications
applications that exploit heterogeneous data from different sources
However because the Web is large it is nontrivial to identify the relevant link data sources
However because the Web is continuously evolving it is nontrivial to identify the relevant link data sources
However because the Web is continuously evolving it is nontrivial to express some given information needs as structured queries against the relevant link data sources
However because the Web is large it is nontrivial to express some given information needs as structured queries against the relevant link data sources
In this work we allow users to express needs in terms of simple keywords
Given simple keywords we define the problem of finding the relevant sources as the one of keyword query
keyword query routing
As a solution we present a family of The proposed models
The proposed models capture information at different levels representing summaries of varying granularity
The proposed models represent different tradeoffs between effectiveness
The proposed models represent different tradeoffs between efficiency
We provide a theoretical analysis of these tradeoffs carried out in a realworld setting using more than 150 publicly available datasets
We also verify these tradeoffs in experiments carried out in a realworld setting using more than 150 publicly available datasets
