Ontologies underpin the semantic web Ontologies define the concepts contained in a data source
Ontologies underpin the semantic web Ontologies define Ontologies relationships contained in a data source
an ontology can grow extremely large
an ontology that combines information from many different sources
An increasing number of ontologies are available online
an ontology response time becomes slower
As an ontology grows larger more resources are required to use an ontology
Thus we evaluate an online approach in terms of time
an OWL ontology that are infrequently used
an online approach that are cheap to relearn
an OWL ontology that are no longer used
Thus we present an online approach in terms of resources
Thus we evaluate an online approach in terms of resources
an online approach that forgets fragments from an OWL ontology
Thus we present an online approach in terms of time
RoboCup OWLRescue which is an extension of the widely used RoboCup Rescue
In order to evaluate our approach our situate an ontology in a controlled simulation environment RoboCup OWLRescue platform agents are required to perform
platform which enables agents to build ontologies automatically based on the tasks
agents using our approach
our benchmark our approach against other comparable techniques
agents using our approach ontology
our benchmark show that agents spend less time forgetting concepts from agents allowing agents using our approach to spend more time deliberating agents using our approach actions to achieve a higher average score in the simulation environment
