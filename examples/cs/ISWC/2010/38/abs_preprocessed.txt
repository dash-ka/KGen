relatedness measures between ontology concepts are useful in many research areas
Semantic similarity between ontology concepts are useful in many research areas
While similarity only considers subsumption relations to assess how two objects are alike relatedness takes into account a broader range of eg partof

In this paper we present The proposed framework
A new way of computing IC values directly from an ontology structure is also introduced
This new model called Extended Information Content
semantic relations defined in an ontology
This new model takes into account the whole set of semantic relations
existing similarity measures that can be augmented to compute semantic relatedness
The proposed framework enables to rewrite existing similarity measures
a new measure called Feature 
Upon The proposed framework a new measure has been devised
a new measure called FaITH 
a new measure called Information THeoretic 
Extensive experimental evaluations confirmed the suitability of The proposed framework
