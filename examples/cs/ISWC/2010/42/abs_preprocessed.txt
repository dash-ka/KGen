policies are declarations of constraints on the behaviour of components within distributed systems and are often used to capture norms within agentbased systems
a few machineprocessable representations for policies have been proposed
policies that can be limited by the complexity of associated reasoning mechanisms
policies that can be expressed by the complexity of associated reasoning mechanisms
a few machineprocessable representations for policies tend to be either limited in the types of policies
in this paper we argue for a language which enables both policy analysis within the bounds of decidability
in this paper we argue for a language which enables both policygoverned decisionmaking within the bounds of decidability
in this paper we argue for a language that sufficiently expresses the types of policies essential in practical systems
a reasoning mechanism that uses a novel combination of query answering
a reasoning mechanism that uses a novel combination of ontology consistency checking
we then propose an owlbased representation of a reasoning mechanism
these criteria using
we then propose an owlbased representation of policies
policies that meets these criteria
in this way agentbased systems can be developed that operate flexibly
in this way agentbased systems can be effectively in policyconstrainted environments
