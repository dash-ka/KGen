A number of  semi  automated alignment systems have been proposed in recent years
Most combine a set of similarity functions on structural features to align ontologies
Most combine a set of similarity functions on semantic features to align ontologies
Most combine a set of similarity functions on lexical features to align ontologies

In this case one is forced to rely on manual alignment
In this paper we study whether it is feasible to reuse such expert
expert provided ontology alignments for new alignment tasks
we focus in particular on manytoone alignments where the opportunity for reuse is feasible if alignments are stable
Specifically we define the notion of a cluster as being made of multiple entities in the source ontology S
the source ontology S that are mapped to the same entity in the target ontology T
we test the stability hypothesis that the formed clusters of source ontology are stable across alignments to different target ontologies
If the stability hypothesis is valid the clusters of an ontology S built from an existing alignment with an ontology T can be effectively exploited to align S with a new ontology T

Experimental evaluation also demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing the stability of clusters in improving the alignment process in terms of recall
