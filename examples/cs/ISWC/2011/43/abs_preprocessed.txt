In this paper we study watermarking methods to prove the ownership of an ontology
Different from existing approaches we propose to watermark not by altering existing statements but by removing existing statements
Thereby we approach does not introduce false statements into an ontology
we show how ownership of ontologies can be established with provably tight probability bounds even if only parts of an ontology are being reused
we finally demonstrate the viability of we approach on realworld ontologies
