Linked Stream Data consists of sensors
the standards proposed for Linked Data
sensors enriched with semantic descriptions following the standards
data generated by stream sources
Linked Stream Data consists of data
This enables the integration of stream data with Linked Data collections
This facilitates a wide range of novel applications
Currently available systems use a  black box  approach which delegates the processing to other engines such as streamevent processing engines by translating to other engines provided languages
Currently available systems use a  black box  approach which delegates the processing to other engines such as SPARQL query processors by translating to other engines provided languages
As the experimental results the need for data transformation pose major drawbacks in terms of efficiency

In contrast to the existing systems CQELS uses a  white box  implements the required query operators natively to avoid the overhead and limitations of closed system regimes
In contrast to the existing systems CQELS uses a  white box  approach to avoid the overhead and limitations of closed system regimes
CQELS provides a flexible query execution framework with the query processor dynamically adapting to the changes in the input data
During query execution CQELS continuously reorders operators according to some heuristics to achieve improved query execution in terms of delay

To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach our present extensive experimental performance evaluations in terms of query execution time under varied query types
To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach our present extensive experimental performance evaluations in terms of query execution time under number of parallel queries
To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach our present extensive experimental performance evaluations in terms of query execution time under dataset sizes
These results show that CQELS outperforms related approaches by orders of magnitude
