traditional approaches to this entity coreference problem do not scale because traditional approaches to this entity coreference problem exhaustively compare every pair of instances
in this paper we propose a candidate selection algorithm for pruning the search space for entity coreference
literal values that are chosen using domainindependent unsupervised learning
we select candidate instance pairs by computing a characterlevel similarity on discriminating literal values
we index the instances on the chosen predicates literal values to efficiently look up similar instances
three structured datasets
we evaluate we approach on three
we evaluate we approach on two rdf
we show that the traditional metrics propose additional metrics
we show that the traditional metrics do not always accurately reflect the relative benefits of candidate selection
we show that we algorithm frequently outperforms alternatives and is able to process 1 million instances in under one hour on a single sun workstation
furthermore on the rdf datasets we show that the entire entity coreference process scales well by applying we technique
surprisingly low precision filtering mechanism frequently leads to higher fscores in the overall system
surprisingly this high recall leads to higher fscores in the overall system
