Triple stores have long provided data access
Triple stores have long provided RDF storage access
access using expressive formal query languages such as SPARQL
The new end users of the Semantic Web however are mostly unaware of SPARQL
The new end users of the Semantic Web however overwhelmingly prefer imprecise informal keyword queries for searching over data
the architectures that provide support for the full expressivity of SPARQL
At the same time the amount of data on the Semantic Web is approaching the limits of the architectures
These factors have led to an increased interest in semantic search ie access to RDF data
These factors combined
RDF data using Information Retrieval methods
In this work we propose a method for efficient entity search over RDF data
In this work we propose a method for effective entity search over RDF data
we describe an adaptation of the BM25F ranking function for RDF data
we demonstrate that RDF outperforms other stateoftheart methods in ranking RDF resources
we also propose a set of new index structures for efficient retrieval and ranking of these results
we implement these results
these results using the opensource MG4J framework
