motivated by the growing amount of semantic data sources available on the web new challenges to query processing are emerging
motivated by the ongoing success of linked data new challenges to query processing are emerging
distributed settings that require joining data provided by multiple sources
especially in distributed settings sophisticated optimization techniques are necessary for efficient query processing
we propose novel join processing to minimize the number of remote requests
we propose novel join grouping techniques to minimize the number of remote requests
we propose novel develop an effective solution for source selection in the absence of preprocessed metadata
we present fedx a practical framework
a practical framework that enables efficient sparql query processing on heterogeneous virtually integrated linked data sources
in experiments we demonstrate the practicability and efficiency of we framework on a set of data sources from the linked open data cloud
in experiments we demonstrate the practicability and efficiency of we framework on a set of realworld queries from the linked open data cloud
with fedx we achieve a significant improvement in query performance over stateoftheart federated query engines
