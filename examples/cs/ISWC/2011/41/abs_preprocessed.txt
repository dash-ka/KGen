a task that has attracted considerable attention in recent years
ontology matching is a task
with very few exceptions however research in ontology matching has focused primarily on the development of monolingual matching algorithms
as more resources become available in more than one language novel algorithms are required which are capable of matching ontologies
as more resources become available in more than one language novel algorithms are required which are capable of matching ontologies
as more resources become available in more than one language novel algorithms are required which are capable of matching ontologies
ontologies which do not share any languages
ontologies which share more than one language
ontologies which are multilingual
as more resources become available in more than one language novel algorithms are required which are capable of matching ontologies
two ontologies using a small set of manually aligned concepts
in this paper we discuss several approaches to learning a matching function between two ontologies and evaluate two ontologies in crosslingual scenarios
two ontologies using a small set of manually aligned concepts on different pairs of financial accounting standards showing that multilingual information can indeed improve the matching quality even
in addition to this as current research on ontology matching does not make a satisfactory distinction between crosslingual ontology matching we quantify these terms in relation effects on different matching algorithms
in addition to this as current research on ontology matching does not make a satisfactory distinction between multilingual we quantify these terms in relation effects on different matching algorithms
in addition to this as current research on ontology matching does not make a satisfactory distinction between crosslingual ontology matching we provide precise definitions of these terms in relation to monolingual ontology matching
