Annotation graph datasets are a natural representation of scientific knowledge
Annotation graph datasets are common in the life sciences
the life sciences where genes are annotated with controlled vocabulary terms  from ontologies
the life sciences where proteins are CV terms  from ontologies
the life sciences where genes are CV terms  from ontologies
the life sciences where proteins are annotated with controlled vocabulary terms  from ontologies
LOD  initiative Web technologies are playing a leading role in making such datasets widely available
The W3C Linking Open Data  initiative Web technologies are playing a leading role in making such datasets widely available
LOD  semantic Web technologies are playing a leading role in making such datasets widely available

Scientists can mine such datasets to discover patterns of annotation
While ontology alignment and integration across datasets has been explored in the context of the semantic Web there is no current approach to mine such patterns in annotation graph datasets
In this paper we propose a novel approach for link prediction this paper is a preliminary task when discovering more complex patterns
we prediction is based on a complementary methodology of graph summarization
we prediction is based on a complementary methodology of dense subgraphs
graph summarization can exploit knowledge
knowledge captured in the annotation patterns
graph summarization can summarize knowledge
knowledge captured within the ontologies
dense subgraphs uses the ontology structure in particular the distance between CV terms to filter the graph
dense subgraphs uses the ontology structure in particular the distance between CV terms to to find promising subgraphs
we develop a scoring function based on multiple heuristics to rank the predictions
we perform an extensive evaluation on Arabidopsis thaliana genes
