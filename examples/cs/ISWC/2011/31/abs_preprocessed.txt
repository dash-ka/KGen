we aim at providing a complementary layer for the web semantics being merely asserted by the semantic web
bottomup phenomena that are empirically observable on the semantic web
we aim at providing a complementary layer for the web semantics catering for bottomup phenomena
we focus on meaning that is not associated with particular semantic descriptions
we emerges from the multitude of implicit links on the web of data
we emerges from the multitude of explicit links on the web of data
we claim that the current approaches are mostly topdown
we claim that the current approaches thus lack a proper mechanisms for capturing the emergent aspects of the web meaning
to fill this gap we have proposed a framework based on a successful bottomup approach to meaning representation in computational linguistics 
distributional semantics  that is however still compatible with the topdown semantic web principles due to inherent support of rules

we evaluated we solution in a knowledge consolidation experiment
