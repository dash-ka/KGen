The purpose of data browsers is to help users query data effectively without being overwhelmed by large complex graphs of data
A proposed solution to query data in graphbased datasets is Pivoting 
A proposed solution to identify data in graphbased datasets is a manytomany graph

A proposed solution to identify data in graphbased datasets is Pivoting 
A proposed solution to query data in graphbased datasets is a manytomany graph
instances followed by navigation through common links
technique that allows users to navigate the graph by starting from a set of instances
a manytomany graph browsing technique
Relying solely on navigation however makes it difficult for users to even see if the element of interest is in the graph
the graph when the points of interest may be many vertices apart
Relying solely on navigation however makes it difficult for users to find paths
the necessary connections which further adds to the complexity of pivoting
paths which require combinations of forward links in order to make the necessary connections
paths which require combinations of backward links in order to make the necessary connections
Further challenges include finding paths
In order to enhance the strengths of pivoting we present a multipivot approach which we embodied in tool
In order to mitigate the effects of these problems present a multipivot approach which we embodied in tool
tool called Visor
Visor allows users to explore from multiple points in the graph helping users connect key points of interest in the graph on the conceptual level visually occluding the remainder parts of the graph thus helping create a roadmap for navigation
We carried out an user study to demonstrate the viability of We approach
