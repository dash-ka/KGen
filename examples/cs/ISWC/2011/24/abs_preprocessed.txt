The increasing availability of large RDF datasets offers an exciting opportunity to use such data to build predictive models using machine learning algorithms
a setting where the data can be accessed only through a query interface
However the massive size and distributed nature of RDF data calls for approaches to learning from RDF data in a setting
However the massive size and distributed nature of RDF data calls for approaches to learning from RDF data in the SPARQL endpoint of the RDF store
algorithms that allow the predictive model to be incrementally updated in response to changes in the data
applications where the data are subject to frequent updates
In applications there is a need for algorithms
the attributes that are relevant for specific prediction tasks
Furthermore in some applications the attributes hence need to be discovered by the algorithm
Furthermore in some applications the attributes are not known a priori
We present an approach to learning Relational Bayesian Classifiers from RDF data that addresses such scenarios
Specifically we show how to build Relational Bayesian Classifiers from RDF data using statistical queries through the SPARQL endpoint of the RDF store
one that requires direct centralized access to the data
one that has to retrieve the entire RDF dataset from the remote location for processing
We compare the communication complexity of We algorithm with one
We establish the conditions
the conditions under which the Relational Bayesian Classifier models can be incrementally updated in response to deletion of RDF data
the conditions under which the Relational Bayesian Classifier models can be incrementally updated in response to addition of RDF data
We show how We approach can be extended to the setting where the attributes are not known a priori by selectively crawling the RDF data for attributes of interest
the attributes that are relevant for prediction
We provide open source implementation
We evaluate the proposed approach on several large RDF datasets
