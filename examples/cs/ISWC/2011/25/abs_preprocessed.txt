The MapReduce framework has proved to be very efficient for dataintensive tasks
Earlier work has shown promising results
Earlier work has tried to use MapReduce for large scale reasoning for pD semantics
In this paper we move a step forward to consider scalable reasoning on top of semantic data under ie an extension of OWL pD semantics with fuzzy vagueness 
In this paper we move a step forward to consider scalable reasoning on top of semantic data under fuzzy pD semantics 
To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to investigate how MapReduce for large scale reasoning for pD semantics can help to solve the scalability issue of fuzzy OWL reasoning
While most of the optimizations are also applicable for fuzzy pD semantics unique challenges arise when we handle the fuzzy information
the optimizations used by the existing MapReduce framework for pD semantics
We propose a solution for tackling each of these key challenges
We identify these key challenges
Furthermore we implement a prototype system for the evaluation purpose
The experimental results show that the running time of a prototype system for the evaluation purpose is comparable with that of WebPIE the stateoftheart inference engine for scalable reasoning in pD semantics
