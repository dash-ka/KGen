existential variables in the same way that has been used before in mathematical logic
blank nodes are defined in rdf as  existential variables in the same way
however evidence suggests that actual usage of rdf does not follow this definition
in this paper we thoroughly cover the issue of blank nodes from incomplete information in database theory over different treatments of blank nodes across the w3c stack of rdfrelated standards to empirical analysis of rdf data publicly available on the web
we then summarize alternative approaches to the problem weighing up advantages also discussing proposals for skolemization
