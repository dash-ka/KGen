nowadays communication exchanges are time consuming part of peoples job especially for the so called knowledge workers
nowadays communication exchanges are an integral
an organisation which is only shared with those immediately involved in the particular communication act
contents discussed during meetings instant messaging exchanges informal communication exchanges exchanges therefore constitute a potential source of knowledge within an organisation
contents become
this work poses a knowledge management issue as this kind of contents  buried knowledge 
knowledge enabling topic trends spotting
this work uses semantic technologies to extract buried knowledge
knowledge enabling expertise finding spotting
specifically we claim it is possible to automatically model peoples expertise by monitoring informal communication exchanges
specifically we claim it is possible to automatically model peoples expertise by annotating peoples content to derive dynamic user profiles
profiles are then used to calculate similarity between people
profiles are then used to calculate plot semantic knowledgebased networks
a semantic network which reflects people expertise rather than capturing social interactions
semantic concepts captured from informal content to build a semantic network
the major contribution and novelty of this work is the exploitation of semantic concepts
we validate the approach
the approach using contents from a research group internal mailing list using informal communication exchanges exchanges within the group
the group collected over a ten months period
