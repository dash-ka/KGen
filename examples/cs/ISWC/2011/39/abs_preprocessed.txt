recently much attention has been directed to extending logic programming with description logic  dl  expressions so that logic programs thus are able to reason with ontologies in the semantic web
dl expressions called normal dl logic programs
in this paper we propose a new extension of logic programs with dl expressions
in a normal dl logic program arbitrary dl expressions are allowed to appear in rule bodies
ie atomic concepts  allowed in rule heads
in a normal dl logic program arbitrary dl expressions are allowed to appear in ie atomic concepts 
ie atomic atomic roles  allowed in rule heads
in a normal dl logic program arbitrary dl expressions are allowed to appear in atomic dl expressions 
in a normal dl logic program arbitrary dl expressions are allowed to appear in ie atomic atomic roles 
atomic dl expressions  allowed in rule heads
we extend the key condition of wellsupportedness for normal logic programs under the standard answer set semantics to normal dl logic programs
an answer set semantics for dl logic programs
dl logic programs which satisfies the extended wellsupportedness condition
we extend the key condition of wellsupportedness for normal logic programs under the standard answer define an answer
the answer set semantics for normal dl logic programs
we show that the answer is decidable if the underlying description logic is decidable  eg
