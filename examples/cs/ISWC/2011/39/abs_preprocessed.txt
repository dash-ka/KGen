Recently much attention has been directed to extending logic programming with description logic  DL  expressions so that logic programs thus are able to reason with ontologies in the Semantic Web
Recently much attention has been directed to extending logic programming with description logic  DL  expressions so that logic programs have access to DL knowledge bases
In this paper we propose a new extension of logic programs with DL expressions
DL expressions called normal DL logic programs
In a normal DL logic program arbitrary DL expressions are allowed to appear in ie atomic concepts 
In a normal DL logic program arbitrary DL expressions are allowed to appear in rule bodies
ie atomic concepts  allowed in rule heads
In a normal DL logic program arbitrary DL expressions are allowed to appear in ie atomic atomic roles 
atomic DL expressions  allowed in rule heads

DL logic programs which satisfies the extended wellsupportedness condition
We extend the key condition of wellsupportedness for normal logic programs under the standard answer define an answer
an answer set semantics for DL logic programs
We extend the key condition of wellsupportedness for normal logic programs under the standard answer set semantics to normal DL logic programs
the answer set semantics for normal DL logic programs
We show that the answer is decidable if the underlying description logic is decidable  eg
