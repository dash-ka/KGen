the entities need to have these labels in order to be exposable to humans in a meaningful way
these labels can then be used for displaying the entities in other frontend applications
these labels can then be used for exploring the data
these labels can then be used for displaying the entities in to support keywordbased based search over the web of data
these labels can then be used for displaying the entities in a linked data browser
these labels can then be used for displaying the entities in to support naturallanguage based search over the web of data
far too many applications fall back to exposing the uris of the entities to the user in the absence of more easily understandable representations such as humanreadable labels
in this work we introduce completeness of the labeling
in this work we introduce a number of labelrelated metrics
in this work we introduce the multilinguality of the labeling
in this work we introduce unambiguity of labeling
in this work we introduce the efficient accessibility of the labels
we report we findings from measuring the web of data
data using these metrics
we also investigate which properties are used for labeling purposes since many vocabularies define further labeling properties beyond the standard property from rdfs
