the evolution proved the evolution importance
modelbased approaches where an evolution  of a kb  results in a set of models
recent studies of the topic mostly focussed on modelbased approaches
for kbs such as dl
for kbs such as lite
it was shown that the evolution suffers from inexpressibility
kbs expressed in tractable dls
the result of evolution can not be expressed in lite
the result of evolution can not be expressed in dl
what is missing in these studies is understanding in which lite fragments evolution can be captured what causes the inexpressibility is sufficient to express evolution whether one can approximate it in lite

this work provides some understanding of these issues for eight of revision
this work provides some understanding of these issues for eight of modelbased approaches
modelbased approaches which cover the case of both update
we found what causes inexpressibility lite
we found what isolated a fragment of dl lite
lite where evolution is expressible
for what isolated a fragment of dl lite we provided polynomialtime algorithms to compute evolution results
for what causes inexpressibility lite we provided polynomialtime algorithms to compute evolution results
lite where evolution is expressible
lite evolution corresponding to a wellknown winsletts approach in a dl shoiq  which is subsumed by owl 2 dl 
for the general case we proposed techniques  based on what we called prototypes  to capture dl lite evolution
we also showed how to approximate this evolution in dl lite
