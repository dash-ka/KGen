When ontological knowledge is acquired automatically quality control is essential
We consider an exhaustive manual inspection of the acquired data
We consider the tightest possible approach 
axioms that would lead to an inconsistency
By using automated reasoning We partially automate the process after each expert decision axioms are automatically approved whereas axioms are declined
axioms that are entailed by the already approved statements
this setting to minimize the amount of expert decisions
Adequate axiom ranking strategies are essential in this
