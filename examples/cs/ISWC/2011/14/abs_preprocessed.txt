ontology verification is concerned with the relationship between the intended structures for an ontology
the verification of a particular ontology requires characterization of the models of an ontology up to isomorphism that the models of the ontology are equivalent to the intended structures for an ontology
the verification of a particular ontology requires characterization of the models of an ontology up to a proof that the models of the ontology are equivalent to the intended structures for an ontology

in this paper we provide the verification of the ontology of time which is a firstorder axiomatization of owltime
we present a complete account of the metatheoretic relationships between other time ontologies for points
we present a complete account of the metatheoretic relationships among five modules
we identify five modules within an ontology
we present a complete account of the metatheoretic relationships between other time ontologies for intervals
