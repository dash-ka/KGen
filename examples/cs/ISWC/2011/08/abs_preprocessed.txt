we present the first large scale investigation into the modular structure of a substantial collection of stateoftheart biomedical ontologies namely those maintained in the ncbo bioportal repository
using the notion of atomic decomposition we partition bioportal ontologies into logically coherent subsets
logically coherent subsets which are related to each other by a notion of dependency
we discuss the resulting structures implications on applications of ontologies
we analyze various aspects of the resulting structures
in particular we investigate the usage of these ontology decompositions to extract modules for instance to facilitate matchmaking of semantic web services in sswap 
in particular we describe the usage of these ontology decompositions to extract modules for instance to facilitate matchmaking of semantic web services in simple semantic web protocol

descriptions of those services use terms from bioportal so service discovery requires reasoning with respect to relevant fragments of ontologies

we present a novel algorithm for extracting modules from decomposed bioportal ontologies to ensure logically complete reasoning
bioportal ontologies which is able to quickly identify logically coherent subsets
coherent subsets that need to be included in a module
compared to existing module extraction algorithms bioportal ontologies has improved performance
coherent subsets that need to be included in a module
compared to existing module extraction algorithms bioportal ontologies has the possibility to avoid loading the entire ontology into memory
bioportal ontologies which is able to quickly identify logically coherent subsets
compared to existing module extraction algorithms bioportal ontologies has a number
the results are presented
the results are discussed
a novel algorithm is also evaluated on bioportal ontologies
