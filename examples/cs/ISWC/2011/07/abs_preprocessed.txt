linked data is developing towards a large global repository for structured interlinked descriptions of realworld entities
an emerging problem in many web applications making use of data like linked data is how a lengthy description can be tailored to the task of quickly identifying the underlying entity
as a solution to this novel problem of entity summarization we propose a variant of the random surfer model
the random surfer model that leverages the relatedness and informativeness of description elements for ranking
as a solution to this novel problem of entity summarization we propose relin
we present an implementation of this conceptual model
description elements based on information theory concepts
description elements based on linguistic theory concepts
this conceptual model which captures the semantics of description elements
in experiments involving users our approach outperforms the baselines shown to be useful in a concrete task
in experiments involving realworld data sets our approach outperforms the baselines shown to be useful in a concrete task
the baselines producing summaries that better match handcrafted ones and further
