querying are two wellknown paradigms to search the Semantic Web
Faceted search are two wellknown paradigms to search the Semantic Web
Querying languages such as SPARQL are difficult to use
Querying languages such as SPARQL offer expressive means for searching RDF datasets
Query assistants do not prevent empty results
Query assistants help users to write wellformed queries
Faceted search supports exploratory search and guided navigation and prevents rich feedbacks to fall in empty results 
Faceted search supports exploratory search and guided navigation and prevents rich feedbacks to fall in deadends 
navigation that returns rich feedbacks to users
However faceted search systems do not offer the same expressiveness as query languages
We introduce Querybased Faceted Search  QFS  to reconcile the two paradigms
We introduce Querybased Faceted Search the combination of an expressive query language to reconcile the two paradigms
We introduce Querybased Faceted Search the combination of faceted search to reconcile the two paradigms
In this paper the LISQL query language covers most features of SPARQL
In this paper the LISQL query language generalizes existing semantic faceted search systems
A prototype Sewelis  aka
Camelis 2  a usability evaluation demonstrated that QFS retains the easeofuse of faceted search
Camelis 2  a usability evaluation demonstrated that QFS enables users to build complex queries with little training
Camelis 2  has been implemented
