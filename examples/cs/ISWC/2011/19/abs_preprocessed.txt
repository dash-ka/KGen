We describe an optimised consequencebased procedure for classification of ontologies
ontologies expressed in a polynomial fragment ELH  R of the OWL 2 EL profile
multiple processorscores which increasingly prevail in computer systems
A distinguishing property of We procedure is that our procedure can take advantage of multiple processorscores
We solution is based on a variant of the  given clause  saturation algorithm for firstorder theorem proving where We assign derived axioms to  contexts within which contexts within can be used
We solution is based on a variant of the  given clause  saturation algorithm for firstorder theorem proving where We assign derived axioms to  contexts within which can be processed independently
We describe an implementation of We within the Javabased reasoner ELK
We implementation is lightweight in the sense that an overhead of managing concurrent computations is minimal
This is achieved by employing operations such as  compareandswap 
This is achieved by employing lockfree data structures such as  compareandswap 
preliminary experimental results demonstrating a substantial speedup of ontology classification on multicore systems
We report on preliminary experimental results
In particular one of widelyused medical ontologies SNOMED CT can be classified in as little as 5 seconds
In particular one of the largest SNOMED CT can be classified in as little as 5 seconds
