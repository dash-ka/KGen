we propose a novel application of clustering analysis to identify regularities in the usage of entities in axioms within an ontology
we argue that such regularities will be able to help to identify parts of the schemas and guidelines upon which ontologies are often built especially in the absence of explicit documentation
such analysis can also isolate irregular entities thus highlighting possible deviations from the initial design
generalised axioms that offer a synthetic representation of the detected regularity
the clusters we obtain can be fully described in terms of generalised axioms
we discuss the potential advantages of incorporating our analysis into future authoring tools
in this paper we discuss the results of the application of we analysis to different ontologies
