concept diagrams were introduced for precisely specifying ontologies in a manner more readily accessible to other stakeholders than symbolic notations

in this paper we present a case study on the use of concept diagrams in visually specifying the semantic sensor networks ontology
visually specifying the semantic sensor networks rrb ontology was originally developed by an incubator group of the w3c

a physical object that implements sensing
an observation is observed by a single sensor

in visually specifying the semantic sensor networks rrb ontology
a sensor is a physical object
concepts are captured visually by concept diagrams
concepts are captured precisely by concept diagrams
roles are captured precisely by concept diagrams
other are captured precisely by concept diagrams
roles are captured visually by concept diagrams
these
other are captured visually by concept diagrams
we consider the lessons show how to convert description logic axioms into concept diagrams
we consider the lessons learnt from developing this visual model
we also demonstrate how to merge simple concept diagram axioms into more complex axioms whilst ensuring that diagrams remain relatively uncluttered
