Concept diagrams were introduced for precisely specifying ontologies in a manner more readily accessible to developers than symbolic notations
Concept diagrams were introduced for precisely specifying ontologies in a manner more readily accessible to other stakeholders than symbolic notations
In this paper we present a case study on the use of concept diagrams in visually specifying the Semantic Sensor Networks ontology
visually specifying the Semantic Sensor Networks RRB ontology was originally developed by an Incubator Group of the W3C

an observation is observed by a single sensor
a sensor is a physical object
In visually specifying the Semantic Sensor Networks RRB ontology
In visually specifying the Semantic Sensor Networks RRB ontology
a physical object that implements sensing
concepts are captured precisely by concept diagrams
concepts are captured visually by concept diagrams
roles are captured precisely by concept diagrams

These

We consider the lessons learnt from developing this visual model
We consider the lessons show how to convert description logic axioms into concept diagrams
We also demonstrate how to merge simple concept diagram axioms into more complex axioms whilst ensuring that diagrams remain relatively uncluttered
