in this paper we present fedbench
analyzing the performance of federated query processing strategies on semantic data
in this paper we present a comprehensive benchmark suite for testing
the major challenge lies in the heterogeneity of semantic data use cases at both the data such as varying data incomplete knowledge about data sources
the major challenge lies in the heterogeneity of semantic data use cases at both the data such as varying data varying degrees of query expressiveness
cases where applications may face different settings
the major challenge lies in the heterogeneity of semantic data use cases at both the data such as varying data access interfaces
the major challenge lies in the heterogeneity of semantic data use cases at both the data such as varying data availability of different statistics
the major challenge lies in the heterogeneity of semantic data use cases at both query level such as varying data access interfaces
the major challenge lies in the heterogeneity of semantic data use cases at both query level such as varying data incomplete knowledge about data sources
the major challenge lies in the heterogeneity of semantic data use cases at both query level such as varying data availability of different statistics
the major challenge lies in the heterogeneity of semantic data use cases at both query level such as varying data varying degrees of query expressiveness
a highly flexible benchmark suite which can be customized to accommodate a variety of use cases
accounting for this heterogeneity we present a highly flexible benchmark suite
a highly flexible benchmark suite which can be customized to compare competing approaches
we discuss design decisions highlight the flexibility in customization
we elaborate on the choice of query sets
we elaborate on the choice of data
various application scenarios where we indicate both the benefits
the practicability of we benchmark is demonstrated by a rigorous evaluation of various application scenarios
limitations of the stateoftheart federated query processing strategies for semantic data
