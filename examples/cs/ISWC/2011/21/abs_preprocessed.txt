Answering queries is an important reasoning task in Description Logics hence also in highly expressive ontology languages such as OWL
an even more expressive language that allows for exceptions
an even more expressive language that allows for modeling defaults
an even more expressive language that allows for integrity constraints
Extending such ontology languages with rules such as those expressible in RIFCore and further with nonmonotonic rules integrating default negation as described in the RIFFLD yields an even more expressive language
