semantic web data with annotations is becoming available being yago knowledge base a prominent example
annotated semantic web data using standard database technology
in this paper we present an approach to perform the closure of large rdf schema annotated semantic web data
real fuzzy semantic data extracted from yago in the postgresql database management system
in particular we exploit several alternatives to address the problem of computing transitive closure with real fuzzy semantic data
we benchmark the several alternatives in persistent storage
we benchmark compare to classical rdf schema reasoning providing the first implementation of annotated rdf schema in persistent storage
