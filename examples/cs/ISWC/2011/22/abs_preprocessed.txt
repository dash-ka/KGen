a natural goal for facilitating the reuse and recombination of such content is to model usage policies as part of the data so as to enable automated processing
a natural goal for facilitating the reuse and recombination of such content is to model usage policies as part of the data so as to enable the data exchange
this paper thus proposes a concrete policy modelling language
sharealike that mandate that derived content is published under some license with the same permissions and requirements
a particular difficulty are selfreferential policies such as creative commons sharealike
we present a general semantic framework for evaluating such recursive statements show that a general semantic framework for evaluating such recursive statements explain how it can be evaluated using existing tools
we present a general semantic framework for evaluating such recursive statements show that a general semantic framework for evaluating such recursive statements has desirable formal properties
we then show that we approach is compatible with both owl dl
we then show that we approach illustrate how one can concretely model selfreferential policies in these languages to obtain desired conclusions
we then show that we approach is compatible with both datalog
