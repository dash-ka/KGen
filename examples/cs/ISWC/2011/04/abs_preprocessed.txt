current ontology development tools offer debugging support by presenting justifications for entailments of owl ontologies
while these minimal subsets have been shown to support understanding tasks the occurrence of multiple justifications presents a significant cognitive challenge to users
while these minimal subsets have been shown to support debugging tasks the occurrence of multiple justifications presents a significant cognitive challenge to users
in many cases even a single entailment may have many distinct justifications
justifications for distinct entailments may be critically related
however it is currently unknown how prevalent significant numbers of multiple justifications per entailment are in the field
to address this lack we examine the justifications from an independently motivated corpus of actively used biomedical ontologies from the ncbo bioportal
structural features  such as patterns  which can be exploited in order
we find that the majority of ontologies contain multiple justifications while also exhibiting structural features  such as patterns  to reduce user effort in the ontology engineering process
