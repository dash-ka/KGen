When thousands of vocabularies having been published on the Semantic Web by various authorities a question arises as to how thousands of vocabularies are related to each other
Existing work has mainly analyzed Existing work similarity
In this paper we characterize closeness in expressivity
In this paper we characterize distributional relatedness
In this paper we inspect the more general notion of relatedness
In this paper we characterize the more general notion of relatedness from four angles welldefined semantic relatedness lexical similarity in contents
We present 15 million RDF documents that use 2996 vocabularies
We present an empirical study of these measures on a large real data
a large real data set containing 2996 vocabularies
Then we propose to apply vocabulary relatedness to the problem of postselection vocabulary recommendation
we test a recommender service as part of a vocabulary search engine effectiveness against a handcrafted gold standard
we implement such a recommender service as part of a vocabulary search engine
