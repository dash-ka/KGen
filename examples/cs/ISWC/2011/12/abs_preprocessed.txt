an explicit interpretation phase that maps keywords in a keyword query to structured query constructs
effective techniques for keyword search over rdf databases incorporate an explicit interpretation phase
because of the ambiguity of keyword queries it is often not possible to generate a unique interpretation for a keyword query
consequently heuristics geared toward generating the topk likeliest userintended interpretations have been proposed
however heuristics currently proposed fail to depend on databasedependent properties such as occurrence frequency of subgraph pattern
however heuristics currently proposed fail to capture any userdependent characteristics
databasedependent properties such as occurrence frequency of subgraph pattern connecting keywords
topk interpretations that are not aligned with user intentions
this leads to the problem of generating topk interpretations
keyword query interpretation that personalizes the interpretation process based on a users query context
in this paper we propose a contextaware approach for keyword query interpretation
our approach addresses the novel problem of using a sequence of structured queries in the query history as contextual information for biasing the interpretation of a new query
structured queries corresponding to interpretations of keyword queries
experimental results presented over dbpedia dataset
experimental results show that our approach outperforms the stateoftheart technique on both efficiency and effectiveness particularly for ambiguous queries
