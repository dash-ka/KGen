referential qualities are qualities of an entity
an entity taken with reference to another entity
for example the vulnerability of a coast to sea level rise
an entity x taken with reference to another entity r
in contrast to most nonrelational qualities which only depend on most nonrelational qualities host referential qualities require a referent additional to their host ie a quality q of an entity x
referential qualities occur frequently in ecological systems
ecological systems which make concepts from these systems
these systems challenging to model in formal ontology
in this paper we discuss exemplary resilience vulnerability and affordance as qualities of an entity
an entity taken with reference to an external factor
we suggest an ontology design pattern for referential qualities
the design pattern is anchored in the foundational ontology dolce and evaluated using implementations for the notions vulnerability
the design pattern is anchored in the foundational ontology dolce and evaluated using implementations for the notions resilience
