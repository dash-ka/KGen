In this paper we present LogMap a highly scalable ontology
a highly scalable ontology matching system with  builtin  reasoning
a highly scalable ontology matching system with  diagnosis capabilities
To the best of our knowledge LogMaps is the only matching system
semantically rich ontologies containing tens  of thousands of classes
semantically rich ontologies containing and even hundreds  of thousands of classes
the only matching system that can deal with semantically rich ontologies
In contrast to most existing tools LogMaps also implements algorithms for  on the fly  unsatisfiability detection
In contrast to most existing tools LogMaps also implements algorithms for  repair
our experiments with the ontologies NCI CT confirm that our system can efficiently match even the largest existing biomedical ontologies
our experiments with the ontologies FMA CT confirm that our system can efficiently match even the largest existing biomedical ontologies
our experiments with the ontologies SNOMED CT confirm that our system can efficiently match even the largest existing biomedical ontologies
the ontology obtained by integrating LogMaps output mappings with the input ontologies
Furthermore LogMaps is able to produce a  clean  set of output mappings in many cases in the sense that the ontology is consistent
Furthermore LogMaps is able to produce a  clean  set of output mappings in many cases in the sense that the ontology does not contain unsatisfiable classes
