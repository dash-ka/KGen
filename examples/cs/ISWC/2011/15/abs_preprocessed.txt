in this paper we present an approach to determining the cognitive complexity of justifications for entailments of owl ontologies
we present the results of validating that model via experiments
experiments involving owl users
we introduce a simple cognitive complexity model
the validation is based on test data
test data derived from a large corpus of naturally occurring justifications
test data derived from a diverse corpus of naturally occurring justifications
we contributions include new insights into justification complexity
we contributions include a significant corpus with novel analyses of justifications suitable for experimentation
we contributions include an experimental protocol suitable for model validation and refinement
we contributions include validation for the cognitive complexity model
