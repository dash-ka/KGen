In this paper we present an approach to determining the cognitive complexity of justifications for entailments of OWL ontologies
experiments involving OWL users
We present the results of validating that model via experiments
We introduce a simple cognitive complexity model
test data derived from a diverse corpus of naturally occurring justifications
test data derived from a large corpus of naturally occurring justifications
The validation is based on test data
We contributions include new insights into justification complexity
We contributions include a significant corpus with novel analyses of justifications suitable for experimentation
We contributions include validation for the cognitive complexity model
We contributions include an experimental protocol suitable for model validation and refinement
