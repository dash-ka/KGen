In a semantic P2P network peers rely on alignments between peers ontologies for translating queries
In a semantic P2P network peers use separate ontologies
Nonetheless alignments may be limited incomplete 
translations leading to unsatisfactory answers
Nonetheless alignments generate flawed translations
Nonetheless alignments may be limited unsound 
a trust mechanism that can assist peers to select those in the network
the network that are better suited to answer those in the network
In this paper we present a trust mechanism
the network that are better suited to answer their queries queries
The trust that a peer has towards another peer represents the probability that the latter peer will provide a satisfactory answer
The trust that a peer has towards another peer depends on a specific query
In order to compute trust we exploit peers direct experience
In order to compute trust we perform Bayesian inference
In order to compute trust we exploit both alignments
We have implemented We technique
We conducted an evaluation
answers received
Experimental results showed that trust values converge as more queries are sent
Furthermore the use of trust improves both precision
Furthermore the use of trust improves both recall
