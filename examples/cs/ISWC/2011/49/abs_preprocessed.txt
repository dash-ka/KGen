data quality issues arise in the semantic web because data is created by diverse people andor automated tools
in particular erroneous triples may occur errors in ontology alignment
in particular erroneous triples may occur misuse of ontologies
due to factual errors in the original data source the acquisition tools employed
in particular erroneous triples may occur due to factual errors in the original data source the acquisition tools
we propose that the degree to which a triple deviates from similar triples can be an important heuristic for identifying errors
functional dependency which has shown promise in rdf
inspired by functional dependency we introduce valueclustered graph functional dependency to detect abnormal data in rdf graphs
to better deal with semantic web data this extends the concept of functional dependency on several aspects
first there is the issue of scale since we must consider the whole data schema instead of being restricted to one database relation
second this deals with multivalued properties without explicit value correlations as specified as tuples in databases
third this uses clustering to consider classes of values
focusing on these characteristics we propose a number of heuristics to efficiently discover the extended dependencies
focusing on these characteristics we propose a number of algorithms to efficiently discover the extended dependencies
focusing on these characteristics we propose a number of heuristics to use the extended dependencies to detect abnormal data

experiments have shown that the system is efficient on multiple data sets
experiments have shown that the system also detects many quality problems in real world data
