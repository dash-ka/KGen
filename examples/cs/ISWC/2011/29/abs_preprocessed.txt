observational studies in the literature have highlighted low levels of user satisfaction in relation to the support for ontology visualization and exploration provided by current ontology engineering tools
nonexpert users who rely on effective tool support to be able to make sense of the contents
nonexpert users who rely on effective tool support to be able to make the structure of ontologies
these issues are particularly problematic for nonexpert users
nonexpert users who rely on effective tool support to abstract from representational details
to address these issues we have developed a novel solution for navigating ontologies kcviz
ontology navigation approach starting from the most informationrich nodes
kcviz which exploits an empiricallyvalidated ontology summarization method both to provide concise views of large ontologies and also to support a  middleout  ontology navigation approach  key concepts 
to address these issues we have developed a novel solution for visualizing ontologies kcviz
in this paper we also discuss the encouraging results
a preliminary empirical evaluation which suggest that the use of kcviz provides performance advantages to users
the encouraging results derived from a preliminary empirical evaluation
users tackling realistic browsing
in this paper we present the main features of kcviz
users tackling visualization tasks
