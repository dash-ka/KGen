The proliferation of semantic data on the Web requires RDF database systems to constantly improve RDF database systems scalability
The proliferation of semantic data on the Web requires RDF database systems to constantly improve transactional efficiency
At the same time users are increasingly interested in investigating
At the same time users are increasingly interested in visualizing large collections of online data by performing complex analytic queries
This paper introduces a novel database system for RDF data management called dipLODocus  inyRDF
dipLODocus  inyRDF which supports both transactional and analytical queries efficiently
dipLODocus  inyRDF takes advantage of a new hybrid storage model for RDF data based on recurring graph patterns
In This paper we compare our system performance to stateoftheart solutions for both transactional workloads
In This paper we compare our system performance to stateoftheart solutions for both analytic workloads
In This paper we describe the general architecture of we system
