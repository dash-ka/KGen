the training set for sentiment analysis
in this paper we introduce a novel approach of adding semantics as additional features into the training
for each we add eg  apple product   as an additional feature
for each we measure the correlation of the representative concept with negativepositive sentiment
for each we add iphone semantic concept  as an additional feature
each extracted entity  from tweets
each extracted eg iphone  from tweets
we apply this approach to predict sentiment for three different twitter datasets
we results show an average increase of f harmonic accuracy score for identifying both negative sentiment of around 65
