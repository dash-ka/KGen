In order to evaluate current federation querying approaches a general methodology for conducting benchmarks is mandatory
In this paper we present a classification methodology for federated SPARQL queries
test benchmarks that allows for comparability
test benchmarks that cover diverse characteristics of different queries
a classification methodology for federated SPARQL queries can be used by developers of federated querying approaches to compose a set of test benchmarks
benchmark queries that takes into account the number of sources to be queried
a heuristic called SPLODGE for automatic generation of benchmark queries
We further develop a heuristic
benchmark queries that is based on a classification methodology for federated SPARQL queries
benchmark queries that takes into account the number of several complexity parameters
We evaluate the adequacy of We methodology by applying the adequacy of our methodology on the 2011 billion triple challenge data
