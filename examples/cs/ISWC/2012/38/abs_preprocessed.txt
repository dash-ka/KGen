linked open data obtained from SPARQL
Determining trust of data available in the Semantic Web is fundamental for users in particular for linked open data endpoints

There exist several proposals in the literature to annotate SPARQL query results with values from abstract models adapting the seminal works on provenance for annotated relational databases
We provide an approach capable of providing provenance information for for the first time the major nonmonotonic constructs under multiset semantics
We provide an approach capable of providing provenance information for a significant fragment 
We provide an approach capable of providing provenance information for a large fragment 
The approach is based on the translation of SPARQL into relational queries over annotated relations with values of the most general msemiring also refuting a claim in the literature that the OPTIONAL construct of SPARQL can not be captured appropriately with the known abstract models
