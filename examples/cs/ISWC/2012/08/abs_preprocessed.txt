recent developments in hardware have shown an increase in parallelism as opposed to clock rates
a way that allows for finegrained parallelism
in order to fully exploit these new avenues of performance improvement computationally expensive workloads have to be expressed in a way
in this paper we address the problem of describing rdfs entailment in such a way
different from previous work on parallel rdfs reasoning we assume a shared memory architecture
duplicates that naturally occur in rdfs reasoning and develop strategies towards rdfs reasoning mitigation exploiting all levels of our architecture
we analyze the problem of duplicates
our implement and evaluate our approach on two realworld datasets performance characteristics on different levels of parallelization
our implement and evaluate our approach on study rdfs reasoning performance characteristics on different levels of parallelization
careful optimizations that take into account intricacies of modern parallel hardware
our conclude that rdfs entailment lends rdfs entailment well to parallelization
our conclude that rdfs entailment can benefit even more from careful optimizations
