For a number of years now we have seen the emergence of repositories of research data specified using OWLRDF as representation languages
For a number of years now we have seen the emergence of repositories of research data conceptualized according to a variety of ontologies
This class of solutions promises both to facilitate the integration of research data with other relevant sources of information and also to support more intelligent forms of querying

However an issue is that of characterizing semantically the relations
However an issue is that of generating semantically the relations
the relations that exist between research areas
an issue which has only been partially addressed
This problem has been traditionally addressed by manually creating these taxonomies
the finegrained research topics which define the level at which typically researchers  operate
the finegrained research topics which define the level at which typically and even more so PhD students  operate
these taxonomies do not cater for the finegrained research topics
However
these taxonomies are very coarsegrained
this manual approach is inadequate for a number of reasons
Moreover
researchers RRB evolve slowly
and even more so PhD students RRB evolve slowly
therefore researchers RRB tend not to cover the most recent research trends
therefore and even more so PhD students RRB tend not to cover the most recent research trends
In addition as we move towards a semantic characterization of these relations there is arguably a need for a more sophisticated characterization than a homogeneous taxonomy to reflect the different ways
the different ways in which research areas can be related
external knowledge which is drawn from a number of resources
In this paper we propose Klink a new approach to i  Google Scholar
In this paper we propose Klink a new approach to i  automatically generating relations between research areas and ii  and external knowledge
both machine learning methods
research areas and ii  populating a bibliographic ontology
research areas and ii  which combines both machine
In this paper we propose Klink a new approach to i  Wikipedia
