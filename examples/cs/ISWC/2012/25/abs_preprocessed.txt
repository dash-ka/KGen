for a number of years now we have seen the emergence of repositories of research data conceptualized according to a variety of ontologies
for a number of years now we have seen the emergence of repositories of research data specified using owlrdf as representation languages
this class of solutions promises both to facilitate the integration of research data with other relevant sources of information and also to support more intelligent forms of querying

however an issue is that of characterizing semantically the relations
an issue which has only been partially addressed
however an issue is that of generating semantically the relations
the relations that exist between research areas
this problem has been traditionally addressed by manually creating these taxonomies
these taxonomies are very coarsegrained
however
these taxonomies do not cater for the finegrained research topics
this manual approach is inadequate for a number of reasons
the finegrained research topics which define the level at which typically and even more so phd students  operate

therefore and even more so phd students rrb tend not to cover the most recent research trends
moreover
researchers rrb evolve slowly
therefore researchers rrb tend not to cover the most recent research trends
and even more so phd students rrb evolve slowly
in addition as we move towards a semantic characterization of these relations there is arguably a need for a more sophisticated characterization than a homogeneous taxonomy to reflect the different ways
the different ways in which research areas can be related
in this paper we propose klink a new approach to i  wikipedia
both machine learning methods
external knowledge which is drawn from a number of resources
in this paper we propose klink a new approach to i  automatically generating relations between research areas and ii  and external knowledge
research areas and ii  which combines both machine
in this paper we propose klink a new approach to i  google scholar
research areas and ii  populating a bibliographic ontology
we have tested a number of alternative algorithms evaluation shows that a method performs best with respect to a manually constructed standard
a method relying on the ability to detect temporal relations between research areas
