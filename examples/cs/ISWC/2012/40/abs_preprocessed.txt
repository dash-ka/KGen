first order logic  rewritability is a desirable feature for query answering over geothematic ontologies because in most geoprocessing scenarios one has to cope with large data volumes
fol  rewritability is a desirable feature for query answering over geothematic ontologies because in most geoprocessing scenarios one has to cope with large data volumes
hence there is a need for combined geothematic logics
combined geothematic logics that provide a sufficiently expressive query language
a sufficiently expressive query language allowing for fol rewritability
the dllite family of description logics is tailored towards fol rewritability of query answering for unions of conjunctive queries hence the dllite family of description logics is a suitable candidate for the thematic component of a combined geothematic logic
we show that a weak coupling of dllite with the expressive region connection calculus rcc8 allows for fol rewritability under a spatial completeness condition for the abox
stronger couplings are possible only for spatial calculi as weak as the lowresolution calculus rcc2
stronger couplings allowing for fol rewritability
already a strong combination of dllite with the lowresolution calculus rcc3 does not allow for fol rewritability
