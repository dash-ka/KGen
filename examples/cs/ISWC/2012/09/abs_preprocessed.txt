the primary challenge of machine perception is to define efficient computational methods to derive highlevel knowledge from lowlevel sensor observation data
perception which enable advanced integration and interpretation of heterogeneous sensor data
emerging solutions are using ontologies for expressive representation of concepts in the domain of sensing
emerging solutions are using ontologies for expressive representation of concepts in perception
the computational complexity of owl however seriously limits the computational complexity of owl applicability and use within resourceconstrained environments such as mobile devices
to overcome this issue we employ owl to formally define the inference tasks discrimination and then provide efficient algorithms for these tasks using bitvector encodings and operations
the inference tasks needed for machine perception
to overcome this issue we employ owl to formally define the inference tasks explanation and then provide efficient algorithms for these tasks using bitvector encodings and operations
the applicability of our approach to machine perception is evaluated on a smartphone mobile device demonstrating dramatic improvements in both efficiency and scale
