tasks that arise when trying to discover links on the Web of Data
the complex linking tasks
Timeefficient algorithms are essential to address the complex
Although several lossless approaches have been developed for this exact purpose Timeefficient algorithms do not offer theoretical guarantees with respect to Timeefficient algorithms performance
In this paper we address this drawback by presenting the first Link Discovery approach with theoretical quality guarantees
In particular we prove that given an achievable reduction ratio r we Link Discovery approach HR3 can achieve a reduction ratio r    r in a metric space
  r in a metric space where distances are measured by the means of a Minkowski metric of any order p   2
We compare HR3
the HYPPO algorithm implemented in LIMES 05 with respect to the number of comparisons they carry out
Timeefficient algorithms implemented in the stateoftheart frameworks
In addition we compare we approach with Timeefficient algorithms LIMES 05 to runtime
In addition we compare we approach with Timeefficient algorithms LIMES SILK 25 with respect to runtime
we show that HR3 outperforms these previous approaches with respect to runtime in each of we four experimental setups
