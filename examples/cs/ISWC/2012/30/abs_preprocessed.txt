an increasing amount of data is consumed on the web according to the linked data paradigm
an increasing amount of data is published on the web according to the linked data paradigm
in consideration of both publishers and consumers the temporal dimension of data is important
in this paper we investigate the characterisation and availability of temporal information in linked data at large scale
based on an abstract definition of temporal information we conduct experiments to evaluate the availability of such information using linked data at large scale from the 2011 billion triple challenge  btc  dataset
focusing in particular on temporal information we investigate the approaches proposing guidelines for data consumers
focusing in particular on the representation of temporal metainformation we investigate the approaches proposing guidelines for publishers

we experiments show that the amount of temporal information available in the lod cloud is still very small several different models have been used on different datasets with rdf
