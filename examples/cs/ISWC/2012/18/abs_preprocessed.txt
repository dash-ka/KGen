Like GeoSPARQL these new versions use OGC standards to represent geometries where the original versions used linear constraints
we study the performance of Strabon experimentally most of the times better than all other geospatial RDF stores the performance of Strabon experimentally has been compared with
we show that the performance of Strabon performs most of the times better than all other geospatial RDF stores the performance of Strabon experimentally has been compared with
we show that the performance of Strabon experimentally scales to very large data volumes most of the times better than all other geospatial RDF stores the performance of Strabon experimentally has been compared with
