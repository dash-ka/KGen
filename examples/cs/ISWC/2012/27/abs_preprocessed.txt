Ontology are built around the idea that axioms enable the inference of new facts about the available data
other logical languages are built around the idea that axioms enable the inference of new facts about the available data
In some circumstances
deducing new facts may be undesirable
however the available data is meant to be complete in certain ways
Previous approaches to this issue have relied on syntactically specifying certain axioms as constraints or adding in new constructs for constraints and providing a extended meaning for constraints
constraints that eliminates constraints
constraints that eliminates their ability to infer new facts without requiring the data to be complete ability to infer new facts without requiring the available data to be complete
constraints that reduces their ability to infer new facts without requiring the data to be complete ability to infer new facts without requiring the available data to be complete
constraints that reduces constraints
Previous approaches to this issue have relied on syntactically specifying certain axioms as constraints or adding in new constructs for constraints and providing a different meaning for constraints
We propose to instead directly state that the extension of certain concepts and roles are complete by making certain concepts and roles DBox predicates which eliminates the distinction between regular axioms and constraints for these concepts and roles
This proposal eliminates the need for special semantics
This proposal avoids problems of previous proposals
