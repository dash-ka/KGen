Topk queries ie queries results ordered by a userdefined scoring function are an important category of queries
queries returning the top k
data that can be exploited to speed up query processing
Order is an important property of data
all the matching eg thousands  even if only a limited number k  are requested
a materializethensort processing scheme that computes all the
Stateoftheart SPARQL engines underuse order
all the matching eg thousands  even if eg ten  are requested
all the matching solutions  even if only a limited number k  are requested
all the matching solutions  even if eg ten  are requested
topk queries are mostly managed with a materializethensort processing scheme
The SPARQLRANK algebra is an extended SPARQL algebra
efficient splitandinterleave processing schemes that can be adopted to improve the performance of topk SPARQL queries
an extended SPARQL algebra that treats order as a first class citizen enabling efficient splitandinterleave processing schemes
In this paper we propose an incremental execution model for SPARQLRANK queries we compare the performance of alternative physical operators and we propose a rankaware join algorithm
algorithm optimized for native RDF stores
Experiments conducted with an open source implementation of a SPARQLRANK query engine based on ARQ
Experiments show that the evaluation of topk queries can be sped up by orders of magnitude
