there is currently a wide range of reasoners highly optimised for classification of OWL 2 ontologies
Classification is a fundamental reasoning task in ontology design
There are also several reasoners
several reasoners that are complete for restricted fragments of OWL 2 such as the OWL 2 EL profile
ontologies containing axioms outside the relevant fragment
several reasoners that are complete for restricted fragments of OWL 2 such as the OWL 2 EL profile are much more efficient than fullyfledged OWL 2 reasoners
several reasoners that are complete for restricted fragments of OWL 2 such as the OWL 2 EL profile are much more efficient than several reasoners
several reasoners complete for ontologies
several reasoners that are complete for restricted fragments of OWL 2 such as the OWL 2 EL profile are not
a novel classification technique that combines an OWL 2 reasoner for a given fragment in such a way that the bulk of the workload is assigned to the latter
a novel classification technique that combines an efficient reasoner for a given fragment in such a way that the bulk of the workload is assigned to the latter
In this paper we propose a novel classification technique
the specifics of Reasoners implementation are irrelevant to we approach
Reasoners are combined in a blackbox modular manner
