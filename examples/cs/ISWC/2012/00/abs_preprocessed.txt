classification is a fundamental reasoning task in ontology design
there is currently a wide range of reasoners highly optimised for classification of owl 2 ontologies
several reasoners that are complete for restricted fragments of owl 2 such as the owl 2 el profile
there are also several reasoners
several reasoners complete for ontologies
ontologies containing axioms outside the relevant fragment
several reasoners that are complete for restricted fragments of owl 2 such as the owl 2 el profile are much more efficient than several reasoners
several reasoners that are complete for restricted fragments of owl 2 such as the owl 2 el profile are much more efficient than fullyfledged owl 2 reasoners
several reasoners that are complete for restricted fragments of owl 2 such as the owl 2 el profile are not
a novel classification technique that combines an efficient reasoner for a given fragment in such a way that the bulk of the workload is assigned to the latter
in this paper we propose a novel classification technique
a novel classification technique that combines an owl 2 reasoner for a given fragment in such a way that the bulk of the workload is assigned to the latter
reasoners are combined in a blackbox modular manner
the specifics of reasoners implementation are irrelevant to we approach
