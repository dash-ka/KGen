tracking user interests over time is important for making accurate recommendations
however the widelyused timedecaybased approach worsens the sparsity problem because the widelyused timedecaybased approach deemphasizes old item transactions
we introduce two ideas to solve the sparsity problem
first we divide the users transactions into epochs ie time periods
first we identify epochs
epochs that are dominated by interests similar to the current interests of the active user
thus the users can eliminate dissimilar transactions while making use of similar transactions
similar transactions that exist in prior epochs
second we use a taxonomy of items to model user item transactions in each epoch
this well captures the interests of users in each epoch even if there are few transactions
this suits the situations dynamically change over time do not change so often while individual items often appear
this suits the situations dynamically change over time do not change so often while individual items often disappear
the semantics behind classes do not change so often while individual items often disappear
the situations in which the items transacted by users
the semantics behind classes do not change so often while individual items often appear
fortunately many taxonomies are now available on the web because of the spread of the linked open data vision
we can now use those to understand dynamic user interests semantically
a restaurant visit history gathered from a gourmet guide site
one containing a restaurant visit history
we evaluate we method a music extracted from users tweets
method using a dataset
we evaluate we one
a music listening history
the results show that our method predicts user interests much more accurately than the previous timedecaybased method
