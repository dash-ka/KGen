a system that incrementally executes sparql queries on a hadoop cluster
a system that incrementally translates sparql queries to pig latin
we describe a system
a system that incrementally translates sparql queries to pig latin
a system is designed to work efficiently on complex queries with many selfjoins over huge datasets avoiding job failures even in the case of joins with unexpected highvalue skew
a system that incrementally executes them on a hadoop cluster
statistics gathered during the previous step
to be robust against cost estimation errors a system interleaves query optimization with query execution determining the next steps to take based on statistics

a system that incrementally translates sparql queries to pig latin
to be robust against cost estimation errors a system interleaves query optimization with query execution determining the next steps to take based on data samples
furthermore we have developed a novel skewresistant join algorithm
tuples corresponding to popular keys
algorithm that replicates tuples
we evaluate the effectiveness of we approach both on a synthetic benchmark as well as on a yahoo case of data analysis
a synthetic benchmark known to generate complex queries
a yahoo case of data analysis using rdf data crawled from the web
we results indicate that a system is indeed capable of processing huge datasets without precomputed statistics while exhibiting good loadbalancing properties
