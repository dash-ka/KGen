a system that incrementally executes SPARQL queries on a Hadoop cluster
a system that incrementally translates SPARQL queries to Pig Latin
We describe a system
a system that incrementally translates SPARQL queries to Pig Latin
a system is designed to work efficiently on complex queries with many selfjoins over huge datasets avoiding job failures even in the case of joins with unexpected highvalue skew
a system that incrementally executes them on a Hadoop cluster
statistics gathered during the previous step
To be robust against cost estimation errors a system interleaves query optimization with query execution determining the next steps to take based on data samples

tuples corresponding to popular keys
algorithm that replicates tuples
Furthermore we have developed a novel skewresistant join algorithm
a synthetic benchmark known to generate complex queries
We evaluate the effectiveness of We approach both on a synthetic benchmark as well as on a Yahoo case of data analysis
a Yahoo case of data analysis using RDF data crawled from the web
We results indicate that a system is indeed capable of processing huge datasets without precomputed statistics while exhibiting good loadbalancing properties
