despite the increase in the number of linked instances in the linked data cloud in recent times the absence of links at the concept level has resulted in heterogenous schemas challenging the interoperability goal of the semantic web
in this paper we address this problem by finding alignments between concepts from multiple linked data sources
instead of only considering the existing concepts present in each ontology we hypothesize new composite concepts
new composite concepts defined as disjunctions of conjunctions of rdf types which we generate alignments between these composite concepts
new composite concepts defined as disjunctions of conjunctions of value restrictions which we generate alignments between these composite concepts
new composite concepts defined as disjunctions of conjunctions of rdf types which we call restriction classes
new composite concepts defined as disjunctions of conjunctions of value restrictions which we call restriction classes
those that are simple renderings of relational databases
this extended concept language enables us to even align sources
this extended concept language enables us to find more complete definitions
sources that have rudimentary ontologies such as those
these concepts linked instances
our concept alignment approach is based on analyzing these concepts
our concept alignment approach is based on analyzing the extensions of these concepts
having explored the alignment of conjunctive concepts in our previous work in this paper 
having explored the alignment of conjunctive concepts in our previous work in our focus on concept coverings
our present an evaluation of this new algorithm to genetics domains
our present an evaluation of this new algorithm to biological classification
our present an evaluation of this new algorithm to geospatial
determining the alignments between concepts in refining existing ontologies thus increasing the interoperability in the linked open data cloud
the resulting alignments are useful for refining existing ontologies
