detecting the difference between two description logic is challenging for ontology engineers due in part to the possibility of complex nonlocal logic effects of axiom changes
detecting much less understanding is challenging for ontology engineers due in part to the possibility of complex nonlocal logic effects of axiom changes
two description logic based ontologies
first it is often quite difficult to even determine which concepts have had concepts
concepts meaning altered by a change
second once a concept change is pinpointed the problem of distinguishing whether the concept is indirectly affected by a change has yet to be tackled
second once a concept change is pinpointed the problem of distinguishing whether the concept is directly affected by a change has yet to be tackled
to address the first issue various principled notions of  semantic diff   based on deductive inseparability  have been shown to be computationally practical for the expressively restricted case of elhrterminologies
to address the first issue various principled notions of  semantic diff   based on deductive inseparability  have been proposed in the literature
sroiq which underly
however problems arise even for such limited logics as alc first computation gets more difficult becoming undecidable for logics such as sroiq the web ontology language
second the presence of disjunction make the standard semantic difference too sensitive to change essentially any logically effectual change always affects all terms in the ontology
second the presence of negation make the standard semantic difference too sensitive to change essentially any logically effectual change always affects all terms in the ontology
in order to tackle these issues we formulate the central notion of finding the minimal change set based on model inseparability
changes which are specific to  thus directly affect 
present a method to differentiate changes particular concept names
compare the variously approximated change sets over a series of versions of the nci thesaurus
subsequently we devise a series of computable approximations
