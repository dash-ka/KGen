The paper presents an approach for costbased query planning for SPARQL queries issued over an OWL ontology using the OWL Direct Semantics entailment regime of SPARQL 11
classes that are extracted from a model abstraction
a model abstraction built by an OWL reasoner
The costs are based on information about the instances of classes
properties that are extracted from a model abstraction
The costs are based on information about the instances of properties
A static are presented which use The costs to find near optimal execution orders for the atoms of a query
a dynamic algorithm are presented which use The costs to find optimal optimal execution orders for the atoms of a query
A static are presented which use The costs to find optimal optimal execution orders for the atoms of a query

an individual clustering approach that allows for computing the cost functions based on one individual sample from a cluster
For the dynamic case we improve the performance by exploiting an individual clustering approach
the static ordering usually
we experimental study shows that the static outperforms the dynamic one when accurate statistics are available
This changes however when the statistics are less accurate
This changes however when the statistics are due to nondeterministic reasoning decisions
