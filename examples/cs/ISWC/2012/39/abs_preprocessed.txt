we introduce srbench  completely based on realworld data sets from the linked open data cloud
we introduce a generalpurpose benchmark primarily designed for streaming rdfsparql engines completely based on realworld data sets from the linked open data cloud
solutions in which semantic web technologies are extended for publishing sharing understanding streaming data
with enough tools to gain knowledge from too much streaming data researchers have set out for solutions
solutions in which semantic web technologies are adapted for publishing sharing understanding streaming data
with the increasing problem of too much streaming data researchers have set out for solutions
solutions in which semantic web technologies are adapted for publishing sharing analysing streaming data
solutions in which semantic web technologies are extended for publishing sharing analysing streaming data
srbench with which one can assess the abilities of a strrs engine to cope with a broad range of use cases typically encountered in realworld scenarios
to help researchers comparing streaming rdfsparql  engines in a standardised application scenario we have designed srbench
to help researchers comparing strrs  engines in a standardised application scenario we have designed srbench
to help users comparing strrs  engines in a standardised application scenario we have designed srbench
to help users comparing streaming rdfsparql  engines in a standardised application scenario we have designed srbench
the data sets used in the benchmark
the data sets have been carefully chosen such that the data sets represent a realistic usage of streaming data
the data sets have been carefully chosen such that the data sets represent a relevant usage of streaming data
the data sets used in the benchmark
the benchmark defines a concise yet comprehensive set of queries
queries that cover the major aspects of strrs processing
