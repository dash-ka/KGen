A key issue in semantic reasoning is the computational complexity of inference tasks on expressive ontology languages such as OWL DL
Theoretical works have established worstcase complexity results for reasoning tasks for expressive ontology languages such as OWL DL and OWL 2 DL
However hardness of reasoning about individual ontologies has not been adequately characterised
In this paper we conduct a systematic study to tackle this problem using machine learning techniques covering over four stateoftheart widelyused OWL 2 reasoners
In this paper we conduct a systematic study to tackle this problem using machine learning techniques covering over 350 realworld ontologies
we main contributions are twofold
various classifiers that accurately predict classification time for an ontology based on an ontology metric values
Firstly we learn various classifiers
metrics that can be used to effectively predict reasoning performance
Secondly we identify a number of metrics
we prediction models have been shown to be highly effective achieving an accuracy of over 80
