The amount of data available in the Linked Data cloud continues to grow
Yet few services consume linked data
Yet few services produce linked data
an online service which includes the specifications for consuming
producing linked data requires specialized knowledge of SPARQL
There is recent work
recent work that allows a user to define a linked service from an online service
building such models requires specialized knowledge of SPARQL
building such models is time consuming
building such models requires specialized knowledge of RDF
producing linked data is time consuming
producing linked data requires specialized knowledge of RDF
a new approach that allows domain experts to rapidly create semantic models of services by demonstration in an interactive webbased interface
This paper presents a new approach
First the user provides examples of the service request URLs
Then the system automatically proposes a service model the user can refine interactively
a service specification using a new expressive vocabulary
a new expressive vocabulary that includes lifting rules
a new expressive vocabulary that includes lowering rules
Finally the system saves a service specification
