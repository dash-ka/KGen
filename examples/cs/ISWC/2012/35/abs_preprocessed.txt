This paper presents an approach to automatically extract relationships from textual documents
This paper presents an approach to automatically extract entities from textual documents
a knowledge base that hosts this structured information about domain entities
The main goal is to populate a knowledge base
The extracted entities expected relationships are verified using two evidence based techniques
The extracted entities expected relationships are verified linking
The extracted entities expected relationships are verified using classification
The extracted entities expected relationships are verified using two evidence based techniques
The extracted entities expected relationships are verified linking
The extracted entities expected relationships are verified using classification
other sources which are part of the Linked Open Data cloud
This last process also enables the linking of our knowledge base to other sources
We demonstrate the benefit of We approach through series of experiments with realworld datasets
