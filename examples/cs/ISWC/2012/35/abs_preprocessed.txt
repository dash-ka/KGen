this paper presents an approach to automatically extract entities from textual documents
the main goal is to populate a knowledge base
a knowledge base that hosts this structured information about domain entities
the extracted entities expected relationships are verified using classification
the extracted entities expected relationships are verified linking
the extracted entities expected relationships are verified linking
the extracted entities expected relationships are verified using two evidence based techniques
the extracted entities expected relationships are verified using classification
the extracted entities expected relationships are verified using two evidence based techniques
this last process also enables the linking of our knowledge base to other sources
other sources which are part of the linked open data cloud
we demonstrate the benefit of we approach through series of experiments with realworld datasets
