The lightweight ontology language OWL RL is used for reasoning with large amounts of data
To this end the W3C standard provides a simple system of deduction rules
deduction rules which operate directly on the RDF syntax of OWL
Several similar systems have been studied
However these approaches are usually complete for instance retrieval only
This paper asks how such methods could also be used for computing
This paper asks if such methods could also be used for computing
computing entailed subclass relationships
Checking entailment for arbitrary OWL RL class subsumptions is coNPhard
tractable rulebased reasoning is possible when restricting to subsumptions between atomic classes
however this can not be achieved in any RDFbased rule system
the W3C calculus can not be extended to compute all atomic class subsumptions
Surprisingly
a rule system that is complete for many OWL RL ontologies
a rule system that is sound for many OWL RL ontologies
We identify syntactic restrictions to mitigate this problem and propose a rule system
