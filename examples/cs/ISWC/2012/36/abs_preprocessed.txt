an RDF graph which is not a literal
In RDF or bnode  is a node in an RDF graph
an RDF graph which is not identified by a URI
In RDF or anonymous resource  is a node in an RDF graph
In RDF a blank node  is a node in an RDF graph
complex attributes or resources whose identity is unknown
Several RDFS Knowledge Bases RRB attributes  either associations with other resources  are known
Several RDFS Knowledge Bases RRB attributes  either literals with other resources  are known
Several RDFS Knowledge Bases rely heavily on blank nodes as Several RDFS Knowledge Bases LRB Several RDFS Knowledge Bases RRB are convenient for representing complex attributes or resources
Several RDFS Knowledge Bases RRB attributes  either associations with other resources  are known
Several RDFS Knowledge Bases RRB attributes  either literals with other resources  are known
In this paper we show how we can exploit blank nodes anonymity in order to reduce diff  size when comparing such Several RDFS Knowledge Bases
In this paper we show how we can exploit blank nodes anonymity in order to reduce the delta  size when comparing such Several RDFS Knowledge Bases
The main idea of the proposed method is to build a mapping between the bnodes of the compared Several RDFS Knowledge Bases for reducing the delta size
We prove that finding the optimal mapping is NPHard in the general case
We prove that finding the optimal mapping is polynomial in case there are not directly connected bnodes
Subsequently We present various polynomial algorithms returning approximate solutions for the general case
