one of the main tasks is to provide sources for facts in order to ensure traceability of the provided knowledge
one of the main tasks is to validate facts
so far this task is often addressed by human curators in a threestep process screening those documents for relevant content
so far this task is often addressed by human curators in a threestep process retrieving potentially relevant documents
so far this task is often addressed by human curators in a threestep process issuing appropriate keyword queries for the statement to check using standard search engines
the drawbacks of a threestep process are manifold
most importantly it is very timeconsuming as the experts must often read several documents
most importantly it is very timeconsuming as the experts have to carry out several search processes
in this article we present an algorithm for validating facts by finding trustworthy sources for this article on the web
in this article we present deep fact validation  
in this article we present defacto  
defacto aims to provide an effective way of validating facts by supplying the user with relevant excerpts of webpages defacto has in the correctness of the input fact
defacto aims to provide defacto has in the correctness of the input fact
useful additional information
a score for the confidence
