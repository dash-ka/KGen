So far this task is often addressed by human curators in a threestep process issuing appropriate keyword queries for the statement to check using standard search engines
So far this task is often addressed by human curators in a threestep process screening those documents for relevant content
So far this task is often addressed by human curators in a threestep process retrieving potentially relevant documents
The drawbacks of a threestep process are manifold
Most importantly it is very timeconsuming as the experts have to carry out several search processes
