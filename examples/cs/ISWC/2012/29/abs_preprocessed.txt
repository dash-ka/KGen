existing approaches for link prediction in the domain of network science exploit a networks topology to predict future connections by inducing links
existing approaches for link prediction in the domain of network science exploit a networks topology to predict future connections by assessing existing edges and connections
links given the presence of mutual nodes
despite the rise in popularity of the production of content within such platforms no existing work has attempted to exploit the semantics of published content when predicting network links
despite the rise in popularity of ie microblogging platforms  no existing work has attempted to exploit the semantics of published content when predicting network links
despite the rise in popularity of attentioninformation networks  no existing work has attempted to exploit the semantics of published content when predicting network links
in this paper we present models
an approach that fills this gap by a  significantly outperforming a random baseline
in this paper we present an approach
models that rely solely on network topology information and b 
an approach that fills this gap by a  predicting follower edges within a directed social network by exploiting concept graphs
network topology information and b  assessing the different behaviour that users exhibit when making followeeaddition decisions
the existence of a clear need for topical affinity between users for a follow link to be created
this latter contribution exposes latent factors within social networks
