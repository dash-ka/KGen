the linking open data project is an ongoing effort to construct a global data space ie the web of data
one important part of the linking open data rrb project is to establish owl 
one important part of the linking open data rrb project is to establish sameas links among structured data sources
one important part of the linking open data rrb project is to establish sameas links among structured data sources
one important part of the linking open data rrb project is to establish owl 
such links indicate equivalent instances
equivalent instances that refer to the same realworld object
the problem of discovering owl is called instance matching
the problem of discovering sameas links between pairwise data sources is called instance matching
most of the existing approaches rely on the quality of prior schema matching
prior schema matching which is not always good enough in the open data scenario
the existing approaches addressing the problem of discovering sameas links between pairwise data sources
the existing approaches addressing the problem of discovering owl
in this paper we propose a schemaindependent instancepair similarity metric based on several general descriptive features
we solve the binary classification problem by machine learning algorithms
we transform the instance matching problem to the binary classification problem
some transfer learning methods to utilize sameas links in open data
furthermore we employ some transfer to reduce the demand for labeled data
some transfer learning methods to utilize the existing owl
we carry out experiments on some datasets of oaei2010
the results show that we method performs well on realworld open data data
the results show that we method outperforms the participants of oaei2010
