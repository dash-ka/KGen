ontology alignment using instance
instance based matching of types
in this paper we describe a mechanism for ontology alignment
instancebased matching is known to be a useful technique for matching ontologies
ontologies that have different names
ontologies that have different structures
a key problem in instance matching of types however is scaling the matching algorithm to handle types with a large number of instances
a key problem in instance matching of types however is scaling the matching algorithm to match a large number of type pairs
we propose the use of locality sensitive hashing techniques to vastly improve the scalability of instance matching across multiple types
we show the feasibility of we approach with freebase with hundreds of types respectively
we show the feasibility of we approach with two different type systems with thousands of types respectively
we show the feasibility of we approach with freebase with thousands of types respectively
we show the feasibility of we approach with dbpedia with thousands of types respectively
we show the feasibility of we approach with dbpedia with hundreds of types respectively
we show the feasibility of we approach with two different type systems with hundreds of types respectively
we describe how these techniques can be used to estimate containment relations between two type systems
we compare two different locality sensitive hashing techniques for computing instance similarity
we describe how these techniques can be used to estimate equivalence relations between two type systems
