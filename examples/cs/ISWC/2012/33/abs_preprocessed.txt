these matching tools have emerged that automate this task
the inherent heterogeneity of datasets on the semantic web has created a need to interlink the inherent heterogeneity of datasets on the semantic web
in this paper we are interested in what happens if we enrich these matching tools with knowledge of the domain of the ontologies
we examine various methods to decide what constitutes the domain of a given dataset
we explore how to express the notion of a domain in terms usable for an ontology matching tool
we show how we can use this in a matching tool
we show how we can study the effect of domain knowledge on the quality of the alignment
