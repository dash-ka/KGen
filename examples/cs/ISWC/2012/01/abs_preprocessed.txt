ontology mappings are often assigned a weight factor by matchers
ontology mappings are often assigned a confidence factor by matchers
nonetheless few semantic accounts have been given so far for such weights
this paper presents a formal semantics for weighted mappings between different ontologies
weights are interpreted to measure how complete reclassifications are
it is based on a classificational interpretation of mappings if o 2 are two ontologies then mappings between o 2 are interpreted to encode how elements of x are reclassified in the concepts of o 2

two ontologies used to classify a common set x
x classified in the concepts of o 1
weights are interpreted to measure how precise reclassifications are

this semantics is justifiable by extensional practice of ontology matching
this semantics is a conservative extension of a semantics of crisp mappings
