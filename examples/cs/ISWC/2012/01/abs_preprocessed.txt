Ontology mappings are often assigned a weight factor by matchers
Ontology mappings are often assigned a confidence factor by matchers
Nonetheless few semantic accounts have been given so far for such weights
This paper presents a formal semantics for weighted mappings between different ontologies
It is based on a classificational interpretation of mappings if O 2 are two ontologies then mappings between O 2 are interpreted to encode how elements of X are reclassified in the concepts of O 2

X classified in the concepts of O 1
It is based on a classificational interpretation of mappings if O 1 are two ontologies then mappings between O 1 are interpreted to encode how elements of X are reclassified in the concepts of O 2
weights are interpreted to measure how complete reclassifications are
weights are interpreted to measure how precise reclassifications are
This semantics is justifiable by extensional practice of ontology matching
This semantics is a conservative extension of a semantics of crisp mappings
This paper also includes properties
properties that relate mapping entailment with description logic constructors
