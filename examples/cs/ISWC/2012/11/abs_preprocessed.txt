we propose a framework for querying probabilistic instance data in the presence of an owl2 ql ontology arguing that the interplay of ontologies is fruitful in many applications such as managing data

managing data that was extracted from the web
it can be implemented using standard probabilistic database systems
the prime inference problem is computing answer probabilities
we establish a ptime vs  p dichotomy for the data complexity of the prime inference problem by lifting a corresponding result from probabilistic databases
we also demonstrate that query rewriting  backwards chaining  is an important tool for our framework
we also briefly discuss approximation of answer probabilities
we also show that nonexistence of a rewriting into firstorder logic implies  phardness
