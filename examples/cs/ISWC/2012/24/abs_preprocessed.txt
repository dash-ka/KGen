the size of the extracted base of the extracted base with the original one
the size of the corresponding signature of the extracted base with the original one
the syntactic similarity of the extracted base with the original one
three conflicting requirements arise in the context of knowledge base extraction of the extracted base with the original one
minimal module extraction assign an absolute priority to one of these requirements thereby limiting the possibilities to influence the other two
uniform interpolation assign an absolute priority to one of these requirements thereby limiting the possibilities to influence the other two
el that does not require such an extreme prioritization
we propose a novel technique for el
empirically compare a novel technique for el
el that does not require such an extreme prioritization with existing approaches with encouraging results
we propose a tractable rewriting approach
