Modelling various contexts of users is important to enable personalised selection of Web APIs in directories such as Programmable Web
understanding various contexts of users is important to enable personalised selection of Web APIs in directories such as Programmable Web
Currently relationships between users are not clearly understood by existing selection approaches
Currently relationships between users are not clearly utilized by existing selection approaches
Currently relationships between Web APIs are not clearly utilized by existing selection approaches
Currently relationships between Web APIs are not clearly understood by existing selection approaches
a Web API directory graph that captures relationships such as developers
a Web API directory graph that captures relationships such as Web APIs
a Web API directory graph that captures relationships such as mashups
In this paper we present a semantic model of a Web API directory graph
a Web API directory graph that captures relationships such as categories
We describe a novel configurable graphbased method for selection of Web APIs with personalised aspects
We describe a novel configurable graphbased method for selection of Web APIs with temporal aspects
a novel configurable graphbased method for selection of Web APIs allows users to get more control over users preferences and recommended Web APIs while users can exploit information about users social links and preferences
We show that a novel configurable graphbased method for selection of Web APIs provides more contextualised results than currently available popularitybased rankings
We evaluate a novel configurable graphbased method for selection of Web APIs on a realworld dataset from ProgrammableWebcom
