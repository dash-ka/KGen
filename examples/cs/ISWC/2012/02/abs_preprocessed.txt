a web api directory graph that captures relationships such as developers
in this paper we present a semantic model of a web api directory graph
a web api directory graph that captures relationships such as categories
a web api directory graph that captures relationships such as web apis
a web api directory graph that captures relationships such as mashups
we describe a novel configurable graphbased method for selection of web apis with personalised aspects
we describe a novel configurable graphbased method for selection of web apis with temporal aspects
a novel configurable graphbased method for selection of web apis allows users to get more control over users preferences and recommended web apis while users can exploit information about users social links and preferences
we evaluate a novel configurable graphbased method for selection of web apis on a realworld dataset from programmablewebcom
we show that a novel configurable graphbased method for selection of web apis provides more contextualised results than currently available popularitybased rankings
