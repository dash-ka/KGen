due to the high worst case complexity of the core reasoning problem for the expressive profiles of owl 2 ontology engineers are confused by the performance behaviour of reasoners on ontology engineers ontologies
due to the high worst case complexity of the core reasoning problem for the expressive profiles of owl 2 ontology engineers are often surprised
even very experienced modellers with a sophisticated grasp of reasoning algorithms do not have a good mental model of reasoner performance behaviour
seemingly innocuous changes to an owl ontology can degrade classification time from instantaneous to too long to wait for
similarly switching eg to take advantage of specific features  can result in wildly different classification times
similarly switching reasoners  can result in wildly different classification times
an ontology which are performancedegrading for a given reasoner
in this paper we investigate performance variability phenomena in owl ontologies
present methods to identify subsets of an ontology
when the remainder is much easier for the given reasoner to reason over we designate ideally small rrb subsets  hot spots 
when such  ideally small  subsets are removed from an ontology we designate ideally small rrb subsets  hot spots 
when such  ideally small  subsets are removed from an ontology we designate such rrb subsets  hot spots 
when the remainder is much easier for the given reasoner to reason over we designate such rrb subsets  hot spots 
the identification of these hot spots allows users to isolate difficult portions of the ontology in a principled way
the identification of these hot spots allows users to isolate difficult portions of the ontology in a systematic way
moreover we compare various methods for approximate reasoning based on hot spots

classification time using approximate reasoning based on hot spots
we were able to firstly successfully identify performance hot spots against the major freely available dl reasoners and secondly significantly improve classification time
we verify we techniques with a select set of varyingly difficult ontologies from the ncbo bioportal firstly successfully identify performance hot spots against the major freely available dl reasoners and secondly significantly improve classification time
