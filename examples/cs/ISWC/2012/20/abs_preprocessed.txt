Web APIs have gained the proliferation of mashups
recent Web service technology development owing to Web APIs simplicity of technology stack
Web APIs have gained increasing popularity in recent Web service technology development
However efficiently discovering the relevant documentations on the Web is still a challenging task even with the best resources available on the Web
However efficiently discovering Web APIs is still a challenging task even with the best resources available on the Web
In this paper we cast the problem of detecting the Web API documentations as a text classification problem of classifying a given Web page as Web API associated or not
We propose a supervised generative topic model
feature latent Dirichlet allocation which offers a generic probabilistic framework for automatic detection of Web APIs
a supervised generative topic model called feature latent Dirichlet allocation
feature latent Dirichlet allocation not only also provides a mechanism for incorporating side information such as labelled features automatically learned from data
feature latent Dirichlet allocation not only captures the correspondence between the associated class labels automatically learned from data
feature latent Dirichlet allocation not only captures the correspondence between data automatically learned from data
data that can effectively help improving classification performance
Extensive experiments on our Web APIs documentation dataset shows that a supervised generative topic model outperforms
a supervised generative topic model called feature latent Dirichlet allocation RRB
