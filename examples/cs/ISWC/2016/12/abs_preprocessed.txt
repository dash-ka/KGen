the challenges facing the ontology alignment community
user validation is one of the challenges as there are limits to the quality of automated alignment algorithms
ontology alignments that encompasses the alignment system user interface
in this paper we present a broad study on user validation of ontology alignments
ontology alignments that encompasses the services of the alignment system
ontology alignments that encompasses three distinct aspects
ontology alignments that encompasses three interrelated aspects
ontology alignments that encompasses the profile of the user
we discuss the profile of the user and provide an overview of how current systems address the services of the alignment system
we discuss key issues and provide an overview of how current systems address three interrelated aspects
we discuss the profile of the user and provide an overview of how current systems address the profile of the user
we discuss key issues and provide an overview of how current systems address the profile of the user
we discuss its user interface and provide an overview of how current systems address the services of the alignment system

finally we use experiments from the interactive matching track of the ontology alignment evaluation initiative  oaei  how systems cope with systems as function of systems services
finally we use experiments from the interactive matching track of the ontology alignment evaluation initiative  oaei  2015 to assess the impact of errors in alignment validation
