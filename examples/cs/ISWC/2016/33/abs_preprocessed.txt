The assessment of risk in medicine is a crucial task
scientific knowledge derived by systematic clinical studies on particular knowledge about the current status of a particular patient
scientific knowledge derived by systematic clinical studies on factors
factors affecting health
The assessment of risk in medicine depends on scientific knowledge
Existing nonsemantic risk prediction tools are typically based on hardcoded scientific knowledge and only cover a very limited range of patient states
This makes patient states rapidly out of date
This limited in application particularly for patients with multiple cooccurring conditions
patients based on selfgathered biometric data
In this work we Quantified Self technologies to create The implemented framework for calculating clinical risk predictions for patients
In this work we propose an integration of Semantic Web
data represented according to generic reusable ontologies for representing sensor readings
The implemented framework relies on reasoning to support the integration of data
The implemented framework relies on generic reusable ontologies for representing sensor readings
The implemented framework relies on generic reusable ontologies for representing clinical risk
data represented according to generic reusable ontologies for representing clinical risk
The implemented framework shows a wide range of advantages over existing risk calculation
