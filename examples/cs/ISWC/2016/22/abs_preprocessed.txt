largescale knowledge graphs provide excellent usecases for ontologies
largescale knowledge graphs are widely used in industry
largescale knowledge graphs are widely used in academia
we find however that popular ontology languages such as owl can not express even the most basic relationships on the normalised data format of largescale knowledge graphs
we find however that popular ontology languages such as datalog can not express even the most basic relationships on the normalised data format of largescale knowledge graphs
existential rules may make reasoning undecidable
existential rules are more powerful
normalising existential rules to suit largescale knowledge graphs often also destroys syntactic restrictions
syntactic restrictions that ensure low complexity
syntactic restrictions that ensure decidability
we study this issue for several classes of existential rules
we derive new syntactic criteria to recognise wellbehaved rulebased ontologies over largescale knowledge graphs
