With the success of Open Data a huge amount of tabular data sources became available that could potentially be linked into the Web of  Linked  Data
With the success of Open Data a huge amount of tabular data sources became available that could potentially be mapped into the Web of  Linked  Data
Most rely on mappings of textual information to classes properties
Most transform tabular data into RDF
Most rely on mappings of textual information to instances in RDF knowledge bases in order to link
Most existing approaches to  semantically label  such tabular data
However as we will illustrate Open Data tables typically contain a large portion of numerical columns andor nontextual headers therefore solutions
solutions that solely focus on textual  cues  are only partially applicable for mapping such data sources
We propose an approach to rank candidates of semantic labels for a given bag of numerical values
We propose an approach to find candidates of semantic labels for a given bag of numerical values
We propose an approach to rank candidates of context descriptions for a given bag of numerical values
We propose an approach to find candidates of context descriptions for a given bag of numerical values
information taken from DBpedia to build a background knowledge graph of possible  semantic contexts  for bags of numerical values over which we perform a nearest neighbour search to rank the most likely candidates
To this end we apply a hierarchical clustering over information
finegrained semantic labels when there is enough supporting evidence in the background knowledge graph
Our evaluation shows that Our approach can assign finegrained semantic labels
In other cases Our approach can nevertheless assign high level contexts to the data
the data which could potentially be used in combination with other approaches to narrow down the search space of possible labels
