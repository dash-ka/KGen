a measure supporting the detection of strong relationships between linked data entities
the goal of this work is to learn a measure
such relationships can be represented as paths of entities
such relationships can be represented as paths of properties
such relationships can be obtained through a blind graph search process
a blind graph search process traversing linked data
a costfunction that is able to detect the strongest relationship between two given entities
the challenge here is therefore the design of a costfunction by objectively assessing the value of a given path
to achieve this we use a genetic programming approach in a supervised learning method to generate path evaluation functions that compare well with human evaluations
we show how such a costfunction can be generated only using basic topological features of the nodes of the paths as the paths are being traversed  ie without knowledge of the whole graph 
we show how such a costfunction can be generated only using basic topological features of the nodes of the paths how it can be improved through introducing a very small amount of knowledge about the vocabularies of the properties
the properties that connect nodes in the graph
