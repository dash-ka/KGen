The goal of this work is to learn a measure
a measure supporting the detection of strong relationships between Linked Data entities
Such relationships can be obtained through a blind graph search process
Such relationships can be represented as paths of entities
a blind graph search process traversing Linked Data
Such relationships can be represented as paths of properties
a costfunction that is able to detect the strongest relationship between two given entities
The challenge here is therefore the design of a costfunction by objectively assessing the value of a given path
To achieve this we use a Genetic Programming approach in a supervised learning method to generate path evaluation functions that compare well with human evaluations
we show how such a costfunction can be generated only using basic topological features of the nodes of the paths how it can be improved through introducing a very small amount of knowledge about the vocabularies of the properties
the properties that connect nodes in the graph
we show how such a costfunction can be generated only using basic topological features of the nodes of the paths as the paths are being traversed  ie without knowledge of the whole graph
