the semantics can be used to intermediate heterogeneous users activity logs such information can be used to improve applications
the semantics distributed over largescale knowledge bases
intermediate heterogeneous users activity logs created in services
applications that can help users to decide the next activitiesservices
since user activities can be represented in terms of relationships involving eg a user tags movie items on a webpage  tensors are an attractive approach to represent tensors
since user activities can be represented in terms of relationships involving three things  tensors are an attractive approach to represent tensors
since user activities can be represented in terms of relationships involving more things  tensors are an attractive approach to represent tensors
the recently introduced semantic sensitive tensor factorization is promising as it achieves high accuracy in predicting users activities by basing tensor factorization on the semantics behind objects

however sensitive tensor factorization currently thus has two problems the sparsity problem triggered by insufficient observations within a single service
however sensitive tensor factorization currently focuses on the factorization of a tensor for a single service the balance problem occurs when handling heterogeneous datasets simultaneously

this avoids the low prediction accuracy
the low prediction accuracy caused by the balance problem
assigning semantic bias to each tensor factorization
utilizing shared semantics behind distributed activity logs
this avoids the sparsity problem by sharing semantics among services
experiments show that semantic sensitive simultaneous tensor factorization achieves higher accuracy in rating prediction than the current best tensor method
experiments using realworld datasets
the current best tensor method also extracts implicit relationships across services in the feature spaces by simultaneous factorization with shared semantics
