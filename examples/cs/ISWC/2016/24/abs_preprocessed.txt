applications that can help users to decide the next activitiesservices
The semantics can be used to intermediate heterogeneous users activity logs such information can be used to improve applications
The semantics distributed over largescale knowledge bases
intermediate heterogeneous users activity logs created in services
Since user activities can be represented in terms of relationships involving more things  tensors are an attractive approach to represent tensors
Since user activities can be represented in terms of relationships involving eg a user tags movie items on a webpage  tensors are an attractive approach to represent tensors

the low prediction accuracy caused by the balance problem
This avoids the low prediction accuracy
Utilizing shared semantics behind distributed activity logs
assigning semantic bias to each tensor factorization
This avoids the sparsity problem by sharing semantics among services
Experiments using realworld datasets
Experiments show that Semantic Sensitive Simultaneous Tensor Factorization achieves higher accuracy in rating prediction than the current best tensor method
the current best tensor method also extracts implicit relationships across services in the feature spaces by simultaneous factorization with shared semantics
