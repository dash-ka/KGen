In this setup both the need to process aggregate queries represent challenges for standard SPARQL query processing techniques
In this setup both the size of the datasets represent challenges for standard SPARQL query processing techniques
To overcome these limitations materialized views can be used as a source of precomputed partial results during query processing
To overcome these limitations materialized views can be created as a source of precomputed partial results during query processing
However materialized view techniques as proposed for RDF do not support RDF specifics such as the need to support implicit information
However materialized view techniques as proposed for RDF do not support RDF specifics such as incompleteness to support implicit information
To overcome these challenges this paper proposes MARVEL  MAterialized Rdf Views with Entailment 
To overcome these challenges this paper proposes MARVEL  MAterialized Rdf Views with incompLetness 
rewriting SPARQL queries using
a view selection algorithm based on an associated RDFspecific cost model a view definition syntax
The approach consists of a view selection algorithm
an algorithm for rewriting SPARQL queries materialized RDF views
The experimental evaluation shows that MARVEL can improve query response time by more than an order of magnitude while effectively handling RDF specifics
