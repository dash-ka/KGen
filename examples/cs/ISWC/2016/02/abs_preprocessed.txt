we propose an obda approach for accessing geospatial data using r2rml mappings
geospatial data stored in relational databases
we propose an obda approach for accessing geospatial data using obda mappings
we propose an obda approach for accessing geospatial data using the ogc standard geosparql
we introduce extensions to an existing sparqltosql translation method to support geosparql features
we describe the implementation of we approach in the system ontopspatial an extension of the obda system ontop for creating virtual geospatial rdf graphs on top of geospatial relational databases
we present an experimental evaluation of we system using a stateoftheart benchmark
we present an experimental evaluation of we system extending a stateoftheart benchmark
to measure the performance of our system we confirm our system efficiency
to measure the performance of our system we compare our system to a stateoftheart geospatial rdf store
