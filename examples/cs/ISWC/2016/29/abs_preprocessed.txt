Linked Open Data has been recognized as a valuable source for background information in data mining
However most data mining tools require a vector of numerical features associated with an instance while Linked Open Data sources are graphs by nature
However most data mining tools require features in propositional form associated with an instance while Linked Open Data sources are graphs by nature
However most data mining tools require a vector of nominal features associated with an instance while Linked Open Data sources are graphs by nature
an approach that uses language modeling approaches for unsupervised feature extraction from sequences of words for unsupervised feature extraction to RDF graphs
In this paper we present RDF2Vec an approach
an approach that uses adapts language modeling approaches for unsupervised feature extraction to RDF graphs
graph walks
graph substructures harvested by WeisfeilerLehman Subtree RDF Graph Kernels
We generate sequences by leveraging local information from graph substructures
graph learn latent numerical representations of entities in RDF graphs
We evaluation shows that such vector representations outperform existing techniques for the propositionalization of RDF graphs on a variety of different predictive machine learning tasks
We evaluation shows that feature vector representations of general knowledge graphs such as Wikidata can be easily reused for different tasks
We evaluation shows that feature vector representations of general knowledge graphs such as DBpedia can be easily reused for different tasks
