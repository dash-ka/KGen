The traversalbased approach to execute queries over Linked Data on the WWW fetches data by traversing data links and thus is able to make use of uptodate data from initially unknown data sources
While the downside of The traversalbased approach to execute queries over Linked Data on the WWW is the delay before the query engine completes a query execution user may be improved significantly by returning as many elements of the result
user perceived response time
the result set as soon as possible
a traversal strategy that enables the engine to fetch resultrelevant data as early as possible
To this end the query engine requires a traversal strategy
The challenge for such a strategy is that the query engine does not know a priori which of resultrelevant data sources will contain resultrelevant data
sources discovered during the query execution
In this paper we investigate 14 different approaches to achieve a variety of traversal strategies
In this paper we investigate 14 different approaches to rank traversal steps
We experimentally study traversal strategies impact on response times
We experimentally compare traversal strategies to a baseline
a baseline that resembles a breadthfirst traversal
response times that are worse than the baseline
While We experiments show that some of the approaches can achieve noteworthy improvements over the baseline in a significant number of cases We also observe that for every approach there is a nonnegligible chance to achieve response times
