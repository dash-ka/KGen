in this paper we study instancelevel update in the description logic
in this paper we study instancelevel update in extitdllite  a
the description logic underlying the owl 2 ql standard
in particular we focus on formulabased approaches to abox insertion and deletion
extitdllite  a which is wellknown for enjoying firstorder rewritability of query answering
we show that extitdllite  a enjoys a firstorder rewritability property also for updates
that is every update can be reformulated into a set of insertion instructions computable through a nonrecursive datalog program
that is every update can be reformulated into a set of deletion instructions computable through a nonrecursive datalog program
the abox considered as a database
the abox considered into sql
such a program is readily translatable into a firstorder query over the abox
some experiments showing that the approach works in practice
by exploiting this result we implement an update component for extitdllite  a perform some experiments
by exploiting this result we implement an update component for extitdllite  a based systems
