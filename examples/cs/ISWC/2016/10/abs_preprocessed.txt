In this paper we study instancelevel update in extitDLLite  A
the description logic underlying the owl 2 ql standard
In this paper we study instancelevel update in the description logic
In particular we focus on formulabased approaches to ABox insertion and deletion
we show that extitDLLite  A enjoys a firstorder rewritability property also for updates
extitDLLite  A which is wellknown for enjoying firstorder rewritability of query answering
That is every update can be reformulated into a set of deletion instructions computable through a nonrecursive datalog program
That is every update can be reformulated into a set of insertion instructions computable through a nonrecursive datalog program
the ABox considered into sql
the ABox considered as a database
Such a program is readily translatable into a firstorder query over the ABox
some experiments showing that the approach works in practice
By exploiting this result we implement an update component for extitDLLite  A based systems
By exploiting this result we implement an update component for extitDLLite  A perform some experiments
