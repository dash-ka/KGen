Evaluating joins over RDF data stored in a sharednothing server cluster is key to processing truly large RDF datasets
the data exchange operator that is inserted into the query plan statically  ie at query compile time  to shuffle data between servers
To the best of our knowledge the existing approaches use a variant of the data exchange operator
we present a novel solution to distributed query
distributed query answering that consists of two main components
our argue that such approaches often miss opportunities for local computation
First we present a query
dynamic data exchange which exploits data locality to maximise the amount of computation on a single server
a query answering algorithm based on dynamic data exchange
Second we present a partitioning algorithm for RDF data
graph partitioning whose aim is to increase data locality
RDF data based on graph partitioning
our performance evaluation suggests that our techniques outperform the state of the art by up to an order of magnitude in terms of network communication
our performance evaluation suggests that our techniques outperform the state of the art by up to an order of magnitude in terms of query evaluation times
our performance evaluation suggests that our techniques outperform the state of the art by up to an order of magnitude in terms of memory use
our have implemented our approach in the RDFox system
