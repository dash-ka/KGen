entity resolution is the task of identifying all mentions that represent the same realworld entity within a knowledge base
entity resolution is the task of identifying all mentions that represent the same realworld entity across multiple knowledge bases
rdf graphs containing multiple types of nodes
we address the problem of performing entity resolution on rdf graphs using the links between instances of different types to improve the accuracy
for example in a graph of products the goal is to resolve all the manufacturers
for example in a graph of manufacturers the goal is to resolve all the products
for example in a graph of products the goal is to resolve all the products
for example in a graph of manufacturers the goal is to resolve all the manufacturers
we formulate this problem as a multitype graph summarization problem
a multitype graph summarization problem which involves clustering the nodes in each type
super nodes that summarize the intercluster links in the original graph
each type that refer to the same entity creating weighted links among super nodes
each type that refer to the same entity into one super node
experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms several stateoftheart generic entity resolution approaches especially in data sets with missing values
