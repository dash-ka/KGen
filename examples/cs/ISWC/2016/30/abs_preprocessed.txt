To realise a semantic Web of Things the challenge of achieving efficient SPARQL query performance on Internet of Things devices with limited resources has to be addressed
To realise a semantic Web of Things the challenge of achieving efficient Resource Description Format storage on Internet of Things devices with limited resources has to be addressed
Stateoftheart SPARQLtoSQL engines have been shown to outperform Resource Description Format stores on some benchmarks
timeseries Things data structures that employs efficient translation by reusing existing SPARQL engines to produce Linked Data justintime
timeseries Things data structures that employs metadata abstraction by reusing existing SPARQL engines to produce Linked Data justintime
In this paper we describe an optimisation to the SPARQLtoSQL approach based on a study of timeseries Things data structures 
We evaluate We approach against Resource Description Format stores in the context of scenarios

We evaluate We approach against stateoftheart SPARQLtoSQL engines in the context of scenarios
We show that query performance can be improved from 2 times to 3 orders of magnitude
We show that storage efficiency can be improved from 2 times to 3 orders of magnitude
We show that with succinct row storage can be improved from 2 times to 3 orders of magnitude
