while a growing amount is becoming freely available through the open data movement statistical data in the form of rdf data cubes is opaque to laypersons
semantic question answering technologies provide intuitive access via freeform natural language queries
general semantic question answering systems can not process rdf data cubes
on the intersection between semantic question answering we create a new subfield of semantic question answering called rdcqa
on the intersection between rdf data cubes we create a new subfield of semantic question answering called rdcqa
we create an rdqca benchmark as task 3 of the qald6 evaluation challenge to stimulate further research
we create an rdqca benchmark as task 3 of the qald6 evaluation challenge to enable quantitative comparison between rdcqa systems
independent cubeqa algorithm which achieves a global f  1 score of 043 on the qald6t3test benchmark
we design independent cubeqa algorithm
independent cubeqa algorithm which is the first rdcqa system
1 score of 043 on the qald6t3test benchmark showing that rdcqa is feasible
we evaluate the domain independent cubeqa algorithm
