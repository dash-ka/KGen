The unprecedented growth in mobile devices combined with advances in Semantic Web Technologies has given birth to opportunities for more intelligent systems onthego
approaches that make mobile reasoning more applicable
Limited resources of mobile devices demand approaches
While MobileCloud integration is a promising method for harnessing the power of semantic technologies in the mobile infrastructure MobileCloud integration is an open question how to decide when to reason over ontologies on mobile devices
mobile devices that allows an analysis of the feasibility of performing an ontology reasoning on a mobile device with respect to energy consumption
In this paper we introduce an energy consumption prediction mechanism for ontology reasoning on mobile devices
The developed prediction model helps to improve further developments in semantic reasoning in general
The developed prediction model contributes to mobilecloud integration
