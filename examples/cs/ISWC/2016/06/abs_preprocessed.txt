Despite the emergence and growth of numerous large knowledge graphs many important facts about our everyday world are not readily available on the Web
Despite the emergence and growth of numerous large knowledge graphs many basic facts about our everyday world are not readily available on the Web
To address this we present WebBrain
To address this we present a new approach for harvesting commonsense knowledge
commonsense knowledge that relies on joint learning from Webscale data to fill gaps in the knowledge acquisition
textual patterns found on the Web
We train a neural network model to learn relations based on large numbers of textual patterns
At the same time a neural network model learns vector representations of general word semantics
commonsense knowledge that relies on joint learning from Webscale data to fill gaps in the knowledge acquisition
a new approach for harvesting commonsense knowledge allows us to generalize beyond the explicitly extracted information
Experiments show that we can obtain representations of words yet also allow us to capture conceptual relationships
