Resolving the semantic heterogeneity in the semantic web requires finding correspondences between ontologies
ontologies describing resources
In particular with the explosive growth of data sets in the Linked Open Data linking multiple vocabularies and ontologies simultaneously known as holistic matching problem becomes necessary
Currently most stateoftheart matching approaches are limited to pairwise matching
a linear program extending the maximumweighted graph matching problem with cardinality 
In this paper we propose a holistic ontology matching approach
a linear program extending the maximumweighted graph matching problem with structural 
a linear program extending the maximumweighted graph matching problem with coherence constraints 
a holistic ontology matching approach that is modeled through a linear program
a linear program extending the maximumweighted graph matching problem with linear constraints 
a linear program extending the maximumweighted graph matching problem with structural RRB
a holistic ontology matching approach
a linear program extending the maximumweighted graph matching problem with linear constraints RRB
a linear program extending the maximumweighted graph matching problem with coherence constraints RRB
approach that is modeled through a linear program
a linear program extending the maximumweighted graph matching problem with cardinality RRB
a holistic ontology guarantees the optimal solution with mostly coherent alignments
experiments performed on the Conference track of the OAEI 2015 under both holistic and pairwise matching settings
To evaluate we proposal we discuss the results of experiments
