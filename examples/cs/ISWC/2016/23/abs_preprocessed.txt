resolving the semantic heterogeneity in the semantic web requires finding correspondences between ontologies
ontologies describing resources
in particular with the explosive growth of data sets in the linked open data linking multiple vocabularies and ontologies simultaneously known as holistic matching problem becomes necessary
currently most stateoftheart matching approaches are limited to pairwise matching
a linear program extending the maximumweighted graph matching problem with structural 
a linear program extending the maximumweighted graph matching problem with cardinality 
a linear program extending the maximumweighted graph matching problem with linear constraints 
a linear program extending the maximumweighted graph matching problem with coherence constraints 
in this paper we propose a holistic ontology matching approach
a holistic ontology matching approach that is modeled through a linear program
a holistic ontology guarantees the optimal solution with mostly coherent alignments

experiments performed on the conference track of the oaei 2015 under both holistic and pairwise matching settings
to evaluate we proposal we discuss the results of experiments
