alignments between ontologies usually come with numerical attributes
numerical attributes expressing the confidence of each correspondence
semantics supporting such confidences
semantics must generalise the semantics of alignments without confidence
a semantics which satisfies this
there exists a semantics
a semantics which introduces a discontinuity between nonweighted interpretations
a semantics which introduces a discontinuity between weighted interpretations
moreover this does not provide a calculus for reasoning with weighted ontology alignments
this paper introduces a calculus for such alignments
this paper is given by an infinite relationtype algebra the elements of which are weighted taxonomic relations
in addition this paper approximates the nonweighted case in a continuous manner
