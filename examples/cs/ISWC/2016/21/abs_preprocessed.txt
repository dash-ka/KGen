Alignments between ontologies usually come with numerical attributes
numerical attributes expressing the confidence of each correspondence
Semantics supporting such confidences
Semantics must generalise the semantics of alignments without confidence
a semantics which satisfies this
a semantics which introduces a discontinuity between weighted interpretations
a semantics which introduces a discontinuity between nonweighted interpretations
There exists a semantics
Moreover this does not provide a calculus for reasoning with weighted ontology alignments
This paper introduces a calculus for such alignments
This paper is given by an infinite relationtype algebra the elements of which are weighted taxonomic relations
In addition This paper approximates the nonweighted case in a continuous manner
