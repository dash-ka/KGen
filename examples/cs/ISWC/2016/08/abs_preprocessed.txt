annotations are useful to semantically enrich documents
annotations are useful to semantically enrich other datasets with concepts of standardized vocabularies and ontologies
manual annotation is a difficult process
in the medical domain
a difficult process making automatic annotation methods highly desirable to support human annotators
many documents are not annotated at all
a reusebased annotation approach that utilizes previous annotations to annotate similar medical documents
we propose a reusebased annotation approach
the approach clusters items in documents such as medical forms according to previous ontologybased annotations
the approach clusters items in documents such as medical forms uses similar medical documents to determine candidate annotations for new items
a new contextbased strategy that considers the cooccurrence relatedness of annotating concepts
a new contextbased strategy that considers the semantic relatedness of annotating concepts
the final annotations are selected according to a new contextbased strategy
the evaluation based on previous umls annotations of medical forms shows that the new approaches outperform a baseline approach for finding umls concepts in medical documents
the evaluation based on previous umls annotations of medical forms shows that the new approaches outperform the use of the metamap tool for finding umls concepts in medical documents
