Query containment is one of the building block of query optimization techniques
In the relational world query containment is a wellstudied problem
queries that capture navigation in the graph
At the same time it is wellunderstood that relational queries are not enough to cope with graphstructured data
graphstructured data where one is interested in expressing queries
This paper contributes a study on the problem of query containment for an expressive class of navigational queries
navigational queries called Extended Property Paths
Extended Property Paths are eg nested regular expressions  as they allow to express path conjunction among others
Extended Property Paths are eg nested regular expressions  as they allow to express path negation among others
Extended Property Paths are more expressive than previous navigational extension of SPARQL  as they allow to express path negation among others
Extended Property Paths are more expressive than previous navigational extension of SPARQL  as they allow to express path conjunction among others
We provide complexity bounds
We attack the problem of Extended Property Paths containment
