Conjunctive query answering over expressive Horn Description Logic ontologies is a challenging problem which in some cases can be addressed by application of the chase algorithm
Conjunctive query answering over expressive Horn Description Logic ontologies is a relevant problem which in some cases can be addressed by application of the chase algorithm
In this paper we define a novel acyclicity notion
a novel acyclicity notion which provides SRIQ TBoxes
a novel acyclicity notion which provides a sufficient condition for termination of the restricted chase over Horn
We show that a novel acyclicity notion generalizes most of the existing acyclicity conditions  both theoretically 
a novel acyclicity notion which provides SRIQ TBoxes
We show that a novel acyclicity notion generalizes most of the existing acyclicity conditions  both empirically 
a novel acyclicity notion which provides a sufficient condition for termination of the restricted chase over Horn
a novel acyclicity notion which provides SRIQ TBoxes
a novel acyclicity notion which provides a sufficient condition for termination of the restricted chase over Horn
Furthermore a novel acyclicity notion gives rise to a very efficient reasoning procedure
a materialization based reasoner for acyclic ontologies
We provide evidence for this by providing a materialization
acyclic ontologies which outperforms other stateoftheart systems
