conjunctive query answering over expressive horn description logic ontologies is a challenging problem which in some cases can be addressed by application of the chase algorithm
conjunctive query answering over expressive horn description logic ontologies is a relevant problem which in some cases can be addressed by application of the chase algorithm
a novel acyclicity notion which provides a sufficient condition for termination of the restricted chase over horn
in this paper we define a novel acyclicity notion
a novel acyclicity notion which provides sriq tboxes
a novel acyclicity notion which provides sriq tboxes
a novel acyclicity notion which provides a sufficient condition for termination of the restricted chase over horn
we show that a novel acyclicity notion generalizes most of the existing acyclicity conditions  both theoretically 
we show that a novel acyclicity notion generalizes most of the existing acyclicity conditions  both empirically 
a novel acyclicity notion which provides a sufficient condition for termination of the restricted chase over horn
a novel acyclicity notion which provides sriq tboxes
furthermore a novel acyclicity notion gives rise to a very efficient reasoning procedure
we provide evidence for this by providing a materialization
acyclic ontologies which outperforms other stateoftheart systems
a materialization based reasoner for acyclic ontologies
