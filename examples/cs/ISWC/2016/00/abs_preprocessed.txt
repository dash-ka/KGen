onthefly generation of integrated representations of linked data search results is challenging because linked data rrb search requires successfully automating a number of complex subtasks such as structure inference and matching of both instances and concepts
both instances and concepts each of which gives rise to uncertain outcomes
onthefly generation of integrated representations of linked data search results is challenging because linked data rrb search requires successfully automating a number of complex subtasks such as structure inference and matching of both instances and concepts
such uncertainty is unavoidable given the semantically heterogeneous nature 
such uncertainty is unavoidable given linked data ones
this paper approaches the problem of structuring linked data search results as an evidencebased one
in particular this paper shows how viz probabilistic soft logic  can be exploited to assimilate different sources of evidence to beneficial effect for users
in particular this paper shows how one formalism  can be exploited to assimilate different sources of evidence to beneficial effect for users
in particular this paper shows how one formalism  can be exploited to assimilate different sources of evidence in a principled way
in particular this paper shows how viz probabilistic soft logic  can be exploited to assimilate different sources of evidence in a principled way
this paper considers user evidence in the form of feedback
syntactic evidence derived from matching algorithms
this paper considers syntactic evidence
this paper considers semantic evidence
semantic evidence derived from linked data vocabularies
probabilistic soft logic rules that model the uniform assimilation of diverse kinds of an empirical evaluation of how the resulting probabilistic soft logic programs perform in terms of the resulting probabilistic soft logic programs ability to infer structure for integrating linked data search results
the main contributions are sets of probabilistic soft logic rules and finally a concrete example of how populating such inferred structures for presentation to the end user is beneficial besides enabling the collection of feedback whose assimilation further improves search result presentation
