finding associations between entities is a common information need in many areas
it has been facilitated by the increasing amount of graphstructured data on the web
the web describing relations between entities
a minimal connected subgraph containing all of them
in this paper we define an association
an association connecting multiple entities in a graph as a minimal connected subgraph
entities computed based on a distance oracle
associations which prunes the search space by exploiting distances between entities
we propose an efficient graph search algorithm for finding associations
a conceptual abstract summarizing notable subgroups to be explored
a conceptual abstract summarizing notable subgroups to present an efficient mining algorithm based on canonical codes and partitions
having found a possibly large group of associations we propose to mine frequent association patterns as a conceptual abstract
extensive experiments on large real rdf datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms
