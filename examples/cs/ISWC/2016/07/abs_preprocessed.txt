Finding associations between entities is a common information need in many areas
It has been facilitated by the increasing amount of graphstructured data on the Web
the Web describing relations between entities
a minimal connected subgraph containing all of them
In this paper we define an association
an association connecting multiple entities in a graph as a minimal connected subgraph
associations which prunes the search space by exploiting distances between entities
We propose an efficient graph search algorithm for finding associations
entities computed based on a distance oracle
Having found a possibly large group of associations we propose to mine frequent association patterns as a conceptual abstract
a conceptual abstract summarizing notable subgroups to present an efficient mining algorithm based on canonical codes and partitions
a conceptual abstract summarizing notable subgroups to be explored
Extensive experiments on large real RDF datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms
