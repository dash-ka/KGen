Mapping data to a shared domain ontology is a key step in publishing semantic content on the Web
Most of the work on automatically mapping semistructured sources to ontologies focuses on semantic labeling properties
Most of the work on automatically mapping semistructured sources to ontologies focuses on annotating data fields with ontology classes andor properties

Most of the work on automatically mapping structured sources to ontologies focuses on semantic labeling properties
However a precise mapping needs to describe the semantic relations between the data fields too
a precise mapping that fully recovers the intended meaning of the data
We present a novel approach to automatically discover the semantic relations within a given data source
We mine the small graph patterns occurring in Linked Open Data
We combine the small graph patterns to build a graph
a graph that will be used to infer semantic relations
We evaluated We approach on datasets from different domains
Mining patterns of maximum length five We method achieves an average precision of 75
