Finding relevant concepts from a corpus of ontologies is useful in many scenarios such as web page annotation
Finding relevant concepts from a corpus of ontologies is useful in many scenarios such as document classification
Finding relevant concepts from a corpus of ontologies is useful in many scenarios such as automatic ontology population
Many millions of concepts are contained in a large number of ontologies across diverse domains
A SPARQLbased query demands the knowledge of the structure of ontologies whereas  simpler keywordbased approaches suffer from false positives
A SPARQLbased query demands the knowledge of the structure of the query language whereas userfriendlier suffer from false positives
A SPARQLbased query demands the knowledge of the structure of ontologies whereas userfriendlier suffer from false positives
A SPARQLbased query demands the knowledge of the structure of the query language whereas  simpler keywordbased approaches suffer from false positives
This is because concept descriptions in ontologies may overlap
This is because concept descriptions in ontologies may be ambiguous
In this paper we propose a keywordbased concept search framework in ontologies by constructing contexts for each concept generates the interpretations of a query
In this paper we balances the relevance and diversity of search results
a keywordbased concept search framework which exploits the structure
a keywordbased concept search framework which exploits semantics
A comprehensive evaluation against the domainspecific BioPortal demonstrates that our system outperforms both
the generalpurpose Falcons on widelyused performance metrics demonstrates that our system outperforms both
