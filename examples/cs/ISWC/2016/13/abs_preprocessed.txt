Despite developments of the Semantic Web technologies the gap between nonexpert endusers still exists
Despite developments of the Semantic Web technologies the gap between the Semantic Web still exists
In the field of semantic content authoring tools for interacting with semantic content remain directed at highly trained individuals
this paper adds to the challenges of bringing usergenerated content into the Semantic Web
In this paper we present Seed short for Semantic Editor an extensible knowledgesupported natural language text composition tool for nonexperienced endusers
Semantic Editor enables automatic creation of standards
Semantic Editor enables semiautomatic creation of standards
standards based semantically annotated textual content with focus on the task of text composition
We point out the structure of Seed compare Semantic Editor with related work
We point out the structure of Seed explain how Semantic Editor excels at utilizing Linked Open Data to realize userfriendly generation of textual content for the Semantic Web
We point out the structure of Seed explain how Semantic Editor excels at utilizing state of the art Natural Language Processing to realize userfriendly generation of textual content for the Semantic Web
120 participants which showed that Seed helped endusers easily interact with semantic content with nearly no prerequisite knowledge
We also present experimental evaluation results involving a diverse group of 120 participants
