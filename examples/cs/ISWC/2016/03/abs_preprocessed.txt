in several subject domains classes classes may be subject to categorization resulting in classes of classes 
in several subject domains classes classes may be subject to categorization resulting in classes of or  metaclasses  
when representing these domains one needs to capture not only these domains relations
when representing these domains one needs to capture not only entities of different classification levels
the constraints that apply to entities of these domains relations
the constraints that apply to entities of different classification levels
we observe that this is challenging in current semantic web languages as there is little support to guide the modeler in producing correct multilevel ontologies especially because of the nuances in the constraints
a vocabulary that can be used as a basis for multilevel ontologies in owl along with a number of integrity constraints to prevent the construction of inconsistent models
in order to address these representation challenges we propose a vocabulary
an axiomatic theory called a multilevel modeling theory 
an axiomatic theory called mlt 
in this process we employ an axiomatic theory
