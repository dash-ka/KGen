In recent years there has been an increasing effort to develop techniques for related entity recommendation
related entity recommendation where the task is to retrieve a ranked list of related entities
related entities given a keyword query
account when assessing the relevance of documents
Another trend in the area of information retrieval is to take temporal aspects of a given query into account
However while this has become an established functionality in document search engines the significance of time has not yet been recognized for entity recommendation
In this paper we address this gap by introducing the task of timeaware entity recommendation
the first probabilistic model that takes timeawareness into consideration for entity recommendation by leveraging heterogeneous knowledge of entities
we propose the first probabilistic model
entities extracted from different data sources publicly available on the Web
we extensively evaluate we experimental results show considerable improvements compared to timeagnostic entity recommendation approaches
we extensively evaluate the proposed approach
