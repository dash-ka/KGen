Semantic labeling is the process of mapping attributes in data sources to classes in an ontology
Semantic labeling is a necessary step in heterogeneous data integration
Variations in data formats attribute even ranges of values of data make this a very challenging task
Variations in data formats attribute names make this a very challenging task
automatic semantic labeling that uses machine learning techniques
In this paper we present a novel domainindependent approach to automatic semantic labeling
machine learning to learn a model
a model that extracts features related to the data of a domain
a domain which requires the model to be retrained for every new domain
Previous approaches use machine
Our solution uses similarity metrics as features to compare against labeled domain data
Our solution learns a matching function to infer the correct semantic labels for data
Since Our approach depends on the the data is domainindependent
Since Our approach depends on the the data needs to be trained once to work effectively across multiple domains
the learned the data the data
the learned similarity metrics
other approaches even when the learned models are trained on domains other than the test domain
In Our evaluation Our achieves higher accuracy than other approaches
