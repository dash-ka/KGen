semantic representation which can facilitate bridge language barriers
In this paper we present a knowledge base approach to crosslingual keyword query interpretation by transforming keyword queries in different languages to different languages semantic representation
semantic representation which can facilitate query disambiguation and expansion
The experimental results show that we approach considerably outperforms the baselines
The experimental results show that we approach achieves both high efficiency and effectiveness
