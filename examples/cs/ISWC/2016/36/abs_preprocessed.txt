the amount of entities in large knowledge bases available on the web has been increasing rapidly making the amount of entities in large knowledge bases available on the web possible to propose new ways of intelligent information access
technologies that can enable crosslingual information access
in addition there is an impending need for technologies
as a intuitive way of specifying information needs keyword queries suffer from the challenges
as a intuitive way of specifying information needs keyword queries suffer from
as a intuitive way of specifying information needs keyword queries enjoy widespread usage
as a simple way of specifying information needs keyword queries suffer from the challenges
ambiguity

incompleteness
the challenges
crosslinguality
semantic representation which can facilitate query disambiguation and expansion
semantic representation which can facilitate bridge language barriers
in this paper we present a knowledge base approach to crosslingual keyword query interpretation by transforming keyword queries in different languages to different languages semantic representation
the experimental results show that we approach considerably outperforms the baselines
the experimental results show that we approach achieves both high efficiency and effectiveness
