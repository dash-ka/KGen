data stream applications are becoming increasingly popular on the web
in data stream applications one query pattern is especially prominent a join between some background data
in data stream applications one query pattern is especially prominent a join between a continuous data stream
oftentimes the target some background data is large maintained externally costly to query  both in terms of money 
oftentimes the target some background data is large maintained externally costly to query  both in terms of time 
oftentimes the target some background data is large maintained externally changing slowly
hence practical applications usually maintain a local  cached  view of the original some background data
given that these caches are not updated as the original some background data these caches should be refreshed under realistic budget constraints  in terms of computation time  to avoid stale data
given that these caches are not updated as the original some background data these caches should be refreshed under realistic budget constraints  in terms of latency  to avoid stale data
stale data leading to wrong answers
given that these caches are not updated as the original some background data these caches should be refreshed under realistic budget constraints  in terms of possibly financial cost  to avoid stale data
this paper proposes to model the join between the original some background data as a bipartite graph
this paper proposes to model the join between streams as a bipartite graph
by exploiting the graph structure we keep the quality of results good enough without refreshing the entire cache for each evaluation
updates that have the longest effect
we also introduce two extensions to this method first we consider a continuous join between some some background data to focus on updates
we also introduce two extensions to this method first we consider a continuous join between recent portions of a data stream to focus on updates
second we consider the future impact of a query to the original some background data by proposing to delay some updates to provide fresher answers in future
by extending an existing stream processor with the proposed policies we empirically show that we can improve result freshness by 93
