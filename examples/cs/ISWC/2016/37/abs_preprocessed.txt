Navigational graph queries are an important class of queries
queries that can extract implicit binary relations over the nodes of input graphs
Most of the navigational query languages eg nested regular expressions in nSPARQL are based on the regular expressions
the navigational query languages used in the RDF community
Most of the navigational query languages eg property paths in W3C SPARQL 11 are based on the regular expressions
It is known that regular expressions have limited expressivity for instance some natural queries like same generationqueries are not expressible with regular expressions
To overcome this limitation in this paper we present an extension of SPARQL query language
To overcome this limitation in this paper we present cfSPARQL
SPARQL query language equipped with contextfree grammars
The cfSPARQL language is strictly more expressive than property paths
The cfSPARQL language is strictly more expressive than nested expressions
The additional expressivity can be used for modelling graph summarization
The additional expressivity can be used for modelling ontology alignment
The additional expressivity can be used for modelling graph similarities
Despite The additional expressivity we show that cfSPARQL can be evaluated efficiently
Despite The additional expressivity we show that cfSPARQL still enjoys a low computational complexity
