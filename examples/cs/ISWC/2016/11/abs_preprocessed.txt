According to its modeltheoretic semantics modeltheoretic semantics Semantic Web IRIs are predicate letters
letters whose names are chosen arbitrarily
According to its modeltheoretic semantics modeltheoretic semantics Semantic Web IRIs are individual constants
According to its modeltheoretic semantics modeltheoretic semantics Semantic Web IRIs are carry no formal meaning
At the same time it is a wellknown aspect of Semantic Web pragmatics that IRIs are often constructed mnemonically in order to be meaningful to a human interpreter
The latter has traditionally been termed  social meaning  a concept
a concept that has been discussed
a concept that has been not yet quantitatively studied by the Semantic Web community
the meaning that is  at least  encoded
In this paper we use methods from statistical model learning to quantify the meaning in Semantic Web names
In this paper we use measures of mutual information content
we evaluate the approach over hundreds of thousands of datasets in order to illustrate the approach efficacy
we implement the approach
we experiments confirm that many Semantic Web names are indeed meaningful and more interestingly we provide a quantitative lower bound on how much meaning is encoded in names on a perdataset basis
the first paper that uses statistical model learning as a method to quantify meaning in the Semantic Web context
To we knowledge this is the first paper
To we knowledge this is the first paper about the interaction between social meaning
To we knowledge this is the first paper about the interaction between formal meaning
Semantic Web tools that take such social meaning into account
These insights are useful for the design of a new generation of Semantic Web tools
