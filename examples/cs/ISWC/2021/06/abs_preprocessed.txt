we propose graphhopper a novel method
a novel method that approaches the task by integrating computer vision
a novel method that approaches the task by integrating natural language processing techniques
a novel method that approaches the task by integrating knowledge graph reasoning
concretely our method is based on performing contextdriven sequential reasoning based on the scene entities spatial relationships
concretely our method is based on performing contextdriven sequential reasoning based on the scene entities semantic relationships
concretely our method is based on performing contextdriven sequential reasoning based on the scene entities
a scene graph that describes their mutual relationships
as a first step we derive a scene graph
a scene graph that describes the objects in the image
a scene graph that describes their attributes
subsequently a reinforcement is trained to autonomously navigate in a multihop manner over the extracted scene graph to generate reasoning paths
reasoning paths which are the basis for deriving answers
a reinforcement learning agent
we conduct an experimental study on the challenging dataset gqa based on both automatically generated scene graphs
we conduct an experimental study on the challenging dataset gqa based on both manually curated
we results show that we keep up with human performance on manually curated scene graphs
moreover we find that graphhopper outperforms another stateoftheart scene graph reasoning model on both generated scene graphs by a significant margin
