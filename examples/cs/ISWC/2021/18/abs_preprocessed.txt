relation is essential to enable question answering over knowledge bases
relation linking
the overall endtoend question answering performance
although there are various efforts to improve relation linking performance the current stateoftheart methods do not achieve optimal results therefore negatively impacting the overall endtoend question
in this work we propose a novel approach for relation
relation linking framing this work as a generative problem
a generative problem facilitating the use of pretrained sequencetosequence models
we extend such sequencetosequence models with the idea of infusing structured data from the target knowledge base primarily to enable such sequencetosequence models to handle the nuances of the knowledge base
a structured output consisting of a list of argumentrelation pairs enabling a knowledge validation step
moreover we train the model with the aim to generate a structured output
the existing relation linking systems on four different datasets
we compared we method against the existing relation
four different datasets derived from wikidata
four different datasets derived from dbpedia
a much simpler model that can be easily adapted to different knowledge bases
we method reports large improvements over the stateoftheart while using a much simpler model
