the use of external background knowledge can be beneficial for the task of matching ontologies automatically
the use of external background knowledge can be beneficial for the task of matching schemas automatically
in this paper we exploit six generalpurpose knowledge graphs as sources of background knowledge for the matching task
the background sources are evaluated by applying three different exploitation strategies
the actual background dataset on which the strategy is applied
we find that explicit strategies still outperform latent ones
we find that the choice of the strategy has a greater impact on the final alignment than the actual background dataset
while we could not identify a universally superior resource babelnet achieved consistently good results
we best matcher configuration with babelnet performs very competitively when compared to other matching systems even though no datasetspecific optimizations were made
