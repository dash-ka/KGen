while owl are by far the most popular logicbased languages for semantic web ontologies some welldesigned ontologies are only available in languages with a much richer expressivity such as firstorder logic standard common logic
this inhibits reuse of some welldesigned ontologies by the wider semantic web community
while converting owl ontologies to firstorder logic is straightforward the reverse problem of finding the closest owl approximation of an firstorder logic ontology is undecidable
however for most a  good enough  owl approximation need not be perfect to enable wider reuse by the semantic web community
however for most practical purposes  good enough  owl approximation need not be perfect to enable wider reuse by the semantic web community
first normalizing firstorder logic sentences into a functionfree prenex conjunctive normal that strips away then applying a patternbased approach to identify common owl axioms
this paper outlines such a conversion approach by first
first normalizing firstorder logic sentences into a functionfree prenex conjunctive normal that strips away minor syntactic differences applying a patternbased approach to identify common owl axioms
this paper is tested on the over 2000 firstorder logic ontologies from the common logic ontology repository
