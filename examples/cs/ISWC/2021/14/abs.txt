While OWL and RDF are by far the most popular logic-based languages for Semantic Web Ontologies, some well-designed ontologies are only available in languages with a much richer expressivity, such as first-order logic (FOL) or the ISO standard Common Logic. This inhibits reuse of these ontologies by the wider Semantic Web Community. While converting OWL ontologies to FOL is straightforward, the reverse problem of finding the closest OWL approximation of an FOL ontology is undecidable. However, for most practical purposes, a “good enough” OWL approximation need not be perfect to enable wider reuse by the Semantic Web Community. This paper outlines such a conversion approach by first normalizing FOL sentences into a function-free prenex conjunctive normal (FF-PCNF) that strips away minor syntactic differences and then applying a pattern-based approach to identify common OWL axioms. It is tested on the over 2,000 FOL ontologies from the Common Logic Ontology Repository.
