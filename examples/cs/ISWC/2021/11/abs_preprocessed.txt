Conjunctive query  CQ  answering over knowledge bases is an important reasoning task
However with expressive ontology languages such as OWL query answering is computationally very expensive
The PAGOdA system addresses this issue by using a tractable reasoner to compute lower approximations
upperbound approximations falling back to a fullyfledged OWL reasoner only when these bounds do not coincide
The PAGOdA system addresses this issue by using a tractable reasoner to compute upperbound approximations
lower approximations falling back to a fullyfledged OWL reasoner only when these bounds do not coincide
an ontology language that subsumes all the OWL 2 profiles while still maintaining tractability
in this paper we explore a technique for computing closer approximations via RSA
The effectiveness of this approach critically depends on the quality of the approximations
in this paper we explore a technique for computing closer approximations via an ontology language
We present a novel approximation of OWL 2 ontologies into RSA
an algorithm to compute a closer  than PAGOdA  lower bound approximation using the RSA combined approach
We present a preliminary evaluation of We system
We have implemented these algorithms in a prototypical CQ answering system
We system that shows significant performance improvements wrt PAGOdA
