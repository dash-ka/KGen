OpenStreetMap is one of the richest openly available sources of volunteered geographic information
Although OpenStreetMap includes various geographical entities various geographical entities descriptions are highly heterogeneous incomplete
Although OpenStreetMap includes various geographical entities various geographical entities descriptions do not follow any welldefined ontology
Knowledge graphs can potentially provide valuable semantic information to enrich OpenStreetMap entities
However interlinking OpenStreetMap entities with knowledge graphs is inherently difficult due to the large heterogeneous ambiguous and flat OpenStreetMap schema and the annotation sparsity
This paper tackles the alignment of OpenStreetMap tags with the corresponding knowledge graph classes holistically by jointly considering the instance layers

tagtoclass alignment created using linked entities in knowledge graphs
tagtoclass alignment created using linked entities in OpenStreetMap
We propose a novel neural architecture
a novel neural architecture that capitalizes upon a shared latent space for tagtoclass alignment
We experiments aligning OpenStreetMap datasets for several countries with two of the most prominent openly available knowledge graphs namely Wikidata demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the stateoftheart schema alignment baselines by up to 37 percent points F1score

10 million OpenStreetMap entities worldwide which is over a 400 percent increase compared to the existing annotations
The resulting alignment facilitates new semantic annotations for over 10 million OpenStreetMap entities worldwide
