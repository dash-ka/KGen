semantic markup such as schemaorg allows providers on the web to describe content using a shared controlled vocabulary
this markup is invaluable in enabling a broad range of applications from vertical search engines to rich snippets in search results to actions on emails to many others
in this paper googles focus on semantic markup for datasets specifically in the context of developing a vertical search engine for datasets on the web search
in this paper googles focus on semantic markup for datasets specifically in the context of developing a vertical search engine for datasets on googles dataset search
googles dataset search relies on schemaorg to identify pages
pages that describe datasets
while schemaorg was the core googles also discovered that we need to address the following problem markup do not actually describe datasets
while schemaorg was the core googles also discovered that we need to address pages from 61 percent of internet hosts markup do not actually describe datasets
internet hosts that provide schemaorgdataset
the core enabling technology for this vertical search
we analyze the veracity of dataset markup for googles dataset searchs webscale corpus
we analyze the veracity of dataset markup for googles dataset categorize pages where this markup is not reliable
a deep neuralnetwork classifier that identifies a page with schemaorgdataset markup is a dataset page
we then propose a way to drastically increase the quality of the dataset metadata corpus by developing a deep neuralnetwork classifier
a deep neuralnetwork classifier that identifies whether
a deep neuralnetwork classifier achieves 967 percent recall at the 95 percent precision point
a deep neuralnetwork classifier that identifies a page with schemaorgdataset markup is a dataset page
a deep neuralnetwork classifier that identifies whether
this level of precision enables googles dataset search to use the metadata to provide high quality results to users
this level of precision enables googles dataset search to circumvent the noise in semantic markup
