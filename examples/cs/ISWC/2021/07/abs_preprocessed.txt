Knowledge base question answering aims at automatically answering factoid questions over knowledge bases
For complex questions that require constraints Knowledge base question and query composition
entity linking
For complex questions that require constraints Knowledge base question many challenges and query composition
question understanding eg relation 
many challenges
Knowledge base question answering faces
question understanding component 
question understanding eg type 
question understanding eg entity 
relation linking
type linking
For complex questions that require multiple knowledge base relations Knowledge base question many challenges and query composition
For complex questions that require multiple knowledge base relations Knowledge base question and query composition
component linking
In this paper we propose a novel graph structure
complex questions which can help alleviate the above issues
a novel graph structure called Entity Description Graph to represent the structure of complex questions
DBpedia called EDGQA
By leveraging the Entity Description Graph structure of given questions we implement a QA system over DBpedia
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDGbased decomposition is a feasible way for complex question answering over knowledge bases
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDGQA outperforms stateoftheart results on both LCQuAD and QALD9
