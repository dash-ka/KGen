a novel graph structure called entity description graph to represent the structure of complex questions
complex questions which can help alleviate the above issues
in this paper we propose a novel graph structure
dbpedia called edgqa
by leveraging the entity description graph structure of given questions we implement a qa system over dbpedia
extensive experiments demonstrate that edgbased decomposition is a feasible way for complex question answering over knowledge bases
extensive experiments demonstrate that edgqa outperforms stateoftheart results on both lcquad and qald9
