There are These tables
These tables contain useful information
These tables cover many domains
the data known as semantic descriptions
To make use of These tables for data integration we need precise descriptions of the concepts and relationships in the data
To make use of These tables for data discovery we need precise descriptions of the concepts and relationships in the data
However creating semantic descriptions is a complex process requiring considerable manual effort
However creating semantic descriptions can be error prone
In this paper we present a novel probabilistic approach for automatically building semantic descriptions of Wikipedia tables
then the table uses collective inference to distinguish genuine relationships to form the final semantic description
we approach leverages hyperlinks in a Wikipedia table in Wikidata to construct a graph of possible relationships in the table context
we approach leverages hyperlinks in existing knowledge in Wikidata to construct a graph of possible relationships in the table context
we approach leverages hyperlinks in existing knowledge in Wikidata to construct a graph of possible relationships in the table
we approach leverages hyperlinks in a Wikipedia table in Wikidata to construct a graph of possible relationships in the table
then the table uses collective inference to distinguish spurious relationships to form the final semantic description
tables that require complex semantic descriptions of nary relations  to describe the data accurately
tables that require complex semantic descriptions of implicit contextual values to describe the data accurately
In contrast to existing methods our solution can handle tables
tables that require complex semantic descriptions of eg  to describe the data accurately
tables that require complex semantic descriptions of the population of a country in a particular year  to describe the data accurately
In we empirical evaluation we approach outperforms stateoftheart systems on the SemTab2020 dataset
In we empirical evaluation we approach outperforms stateoftheart systems by as much as 28 percent in F1 score on a large set of Wikipedia tables
