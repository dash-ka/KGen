For many years link prediction on knowledge graphs has been a purely transductive task not allowing for reasoning on unseen entities
Recently increasing efforts are put into emerging entities
Recently increasing efforts are put into exploring semi and fully inductive scenarios enabling inference over unseen
Still all these approaches only consider triplebased knowledge graphs whereas all these approaches richer counterparts eg Wikidata  have not yet been properly studied
Still all these approaches only consider triplebased knowledge graphs whereas all these approaches richer counterparts hyperrelational knowledge graphs  have not yet been properly studied
In this work we study the benefits of employing hyperrelational knowledge graphs on a wide range of semi
fully inductive link prediction tasks powered by recent advancements in graph neural networks
In this work we classify different inductive settings
In this work we study fully inductive link prediction tasks
absolute gains compared to tripleonly baselines
Our experiments on a novel set of benchmarks show that qualifiers over typed edges can lead to performance improvements of 6 percent of absolute gains
