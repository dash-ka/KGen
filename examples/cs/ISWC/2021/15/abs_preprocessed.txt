Unsupervised fact commonly combine scoring to predict the likelihood of assertions being true
Unsupervised fact checking approaches for knowledge graphs
Unsupervised fact commonly combine path search to predict the likelihood of assertions being true
Current approaches search for make no use of continuous representations of knowledge graphs
the discrete search space spanned by the input knowledge graph
Current approaches search for said metapaths in the discrete search space
We hypothesize that augmenting existing approaches with information from continuous knowledge graph representations has the potential to improve continuous knowledge graph representations performance
We approach Esther searches for metapaths in compositional embedding spaces instead of the graph itself
assertions being true that can be exploited by existing fact checking approaches
By being able to explore longer metapaths longer metapaths can detect supplementary evidence for assertions
an ensemble learning setting
We evaluate Esther by combining longer metapaths with 10 other approaches in an ensemble
We results agree with We hypothesis
We suggest that all other approaches can benefit from being combined with Esther by 2065 percent AUCROC on average
