an open knowledge graph built by a global community of volunteers
Wikidata is an open knowledge graph
As Wikidata advances in scale Wikidata faces substantial challenges around editor engagement
substantial challenges are in terms of both retaining existing editors
substantial challenges are in terms of both attracting new editors to keep up with the sheer amount of work
Experience  suggests that personalised recommendations could help especially newcomers
newcomers who are sometimes unsure about how to contribute best to an ongoing effort
Wikipedia suggests that personalised recommendations could help especially newcomers
For this reason we propose a recommender system WikidataRec for Wikidata items
a recommender system uses a hybrid of collaborative filtering techniques to rank items for editors
a recommender system uses a hybrid of contentbased filtering techniques to rank items for editors
editors relying on itemeditor previous interaction
editors relying on both item features
A neural network named neural mixture of representations
A neural network is designed to optimize A neural network with editorbased representation by itemeditor interaction
A neural network named neural mixture of representations
A neural network is designed to learn fine weights for the combination of itembased representations
a second one focusing on the contributions of more than 8
To facilitate further research in this space we also create a generalpurpose one with 220 000 editors responsible for 14 million interactions with 4 million items 000 more active editors
To facilitate further research in this space we also create two benchmark datasets  000 editors responsible for 14 million interactions with 4 million items 000 more active editors
To facilitate further research in this space we also create two benchmark datasets  000 editors responsible for a second one 000 more active editors
To facilitate further research in this space we also create a generalpurpose one with 220 000 editors responsible for a second one 000 more active editors
We perform an offline evaluation of the system on both datasets with promising results
