optimal censors maximizing answers while hiding data
we study information disclosure in description logic ontologies in the spirit of controlled query evaluation where query answering is filtered through optimal censors
data protected by a declarative policy
previous works have considered limited forms of policy typically constituted by conjunctive queries whose answer must never be inferred by a user
also existing implementations adopt approximated notions of censors returned to the users
censors that might result too restrictive in the practice in terms of the amount of nonprotected information
a secret that can be disclosed to a user
in this paper we enrich the framework by extending conjunctive queries in the policy with comparison predicates and introducing preferences between ontology predicates thus in principle augmenting the throughput of query answers
ontology predicates which can be exploited to decide the portion of a secret
we show that answering conjunctive queries in we framework is firstorder rewritable for safe policies complexity
we show that answering conjunctive queries in we framework is firstorder thus in ac0 in data complexity
we show that answering conjunctive queries in we framework is firstorder rewritable for extitdllitea ontologies complexity
we also present some experiments on a popular benchmark showing feasibility of we approach in a realworld scenario
