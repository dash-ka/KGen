for reusing an rdf dataset understanding an rdf dataset content is a prerequisite
to support the comprehension of an rdf dataset large structure existing methods mainly generate an abridged version of an rdf dataset by extracting representative data patterns as a summary
to support the comprehension of an rdf dataset complex structure existing methods mainly generate an abridged version of an rdf dataset by extracting representative data patterns as a summary
as a complement recent attempts extract a representative subset of concrete data as a snippet
we extend this line of research by injecting the strength of summary into snippet
we propose to generate a patterncoverage snippet that best exemplifies the patterns of entity descriptions and links in an rdf dataset
this extensible approach incorporates formulations of group steiner tree to generate compact snippets
this extensible approach incorporates formulations of set cover problems to generate compact snippets
this extensible approach is also capable of modeling query relevance to be used with dataset search
experiments on thousands of real rdf datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of we approach
