For reusing an RDF dataset, understanding its content is a prerequisite. To support the comprehension of its large and complex structure, existing methods mainly generate an abridged version of an RDF dataset by extracting representative data patterns as a summary. As a complement, recent attempts extract a representative subset of concrete data as a snippet. We extend this line of research by injecting the strength of summary into snippet. We propose to generate a pattern-coverage snippet that best exemplifies the patterns of entity descriptions and links in an RDF dataset. Our approach incorporates formulations of group Steiner tree and set cover problems to generate compact snippets. This extensible approach is also capable of modeling query relevance to be used with dataset search. Experiments on thousands of real RDF datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of our approach.
