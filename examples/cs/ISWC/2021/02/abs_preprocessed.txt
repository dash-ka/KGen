wikidata as one of the largest open collaborative knowledge bases has drawn much attention from practitioners since wikidata as one of the largest open collaborative knowledge bases launch in 2012
as wikidata as one of the largest open collaborative knowledge bases is collaboratively maintained by a community of a great number of volunteer editors understanding have not been studied extensively in previous works
as wikidata as one of the largest open collaborative knowledge bases is collaboratively predicting the departure dynamics of those editors are crucial

our classification model which has not been explored in a similar context and problem for predicting whether a wikidata as one of the largest open collaborative knowledge bases editor will leave the platform
in this paper we investigate the synergistic effect of two different types of features patternbased ones with deepfm as our classification model

in this paper we investigate the synergistic effect of two different types of features statistical ones with deepfm as our classification model
our experimental results show that using the two sets of features with deepfm achieves substantial improvement compared to using either of the sets of features and over a wide range of baselines
our experimental results show that using the two sets of features with deepfm provides the best performance regarding f1 score
