Supervised entity resolution methods rely on labeled record pairs for learning matching patterns between two data sources
Supervised entity resolution methods rely on labeled record pairs for learning matching patterns between more data sources
Active learning minimizes the labeling effort by selecting informative pairs for labeling
all target twosource matching scenarios
The existing active learning methods for entity resolution all target twosource and ignore signals in multisource settings such as the Web of Data
signals that only exist
In this paper we propose a graphboosted active learning method for multisource entity resolution
In this paper we propose ALMSER 
the first active learningbased entity resolution method that is especially tailored to the multisource setting
To the best of our knowledge ALMSER is the first active learningbased entity resolution method
the rich correspondence graph that exists in multisource settings for selecting informative record pairs
ALMSER exploits the rich correspondence graph
In addition the correspondence graph is used to derive complementary training data
We evaluate We method
method using five multisource matching tasks
multisource matching tasks having different profiling characteristics
active learning methods using marginbased query strategies in terms of F1 score on all tasks
active learning methods using committeebased query strategies in terms of F1 score on all tasks
The experimental evaluation shows that leveraging graph signals leads to improved results over active learning methods
