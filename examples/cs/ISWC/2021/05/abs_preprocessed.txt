the concepts in knowledge graphs thus play an indispensable role in many applications
the concepts in knowledge graphs enable machines to understand natural language
however existing the concepts in knowledge graphs have the poor coverage of concepts especially finegrained concepts
in order to supply existing the concepts in knowledge graphs with more finegrained concepts we propose a novel concept extraction framework namely mrcce to extract largescale multigranular concepts from the descriptive texts of entities
in order to supply existing the concepts in knowledge graphs with more new concepts we propose a novel concept extraction framework namely mrcce to extract largescale multigranular concepts from the descriptive texts of entities
bert which can extract more finegrained concepts with a pointer network
specifically mrcce is built with a machine reading comprehension model based on bert
furthermore a random forest are also adopted to enhance mrcces precision and recall simultaneously
furthermore rulebased pruning are also adopted to enhance mrcces precision and recall simultaneously
our experiments evaluated upon multilingual the concepts in knowledge graphs
english probase justify mrcces superiority over the stateoftheart extraction models in the concepts in knowledge graph completion
chinese cndbpedia justify mrcces superiority over the stateoftheart extraction models in the concepts in knowledge graph completion
our experiments justify mrcces superiority over the stateoftheart extraction models in the concepts in knowledge graph completion
particularly after running mrcce for each entity in cndbpedia more than 7053900 new concepts  are supplied into the the concepts in knowledge graph
particularly after running mrcce for each entity in cndbpedia instanceof relations  are supplied into the the concepts in knowledge graph
