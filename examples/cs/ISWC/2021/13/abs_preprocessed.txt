in this paper we investigate an approach
an approach where question answering complements a general purpose interactive keyword search system over rdf
question answering that involves a general purpose entity search service over entity enrichment through sparql
we evaluate a pipeline for question answering
we describe the role of question answering in that context
question answering that involves a general purpose entity search service over answer type prediction
question answering that involves a general purpose entity search service over pretrained neural models
question answering that involves a general purpose entity search service over rdf
we describe we detail
the fact that we start from a general purpose keyword search over rdf makes the proposed pipeline widely applicable and realistic in the sense that the proposed pipeline does not presuppose the availability of knowledge graphspecific training dataset
we evaluate various aspects of the proposed pipeline including the effect of answer type prediction
we evaluate various aspects of the proposed pipeline including the performance of question answering over existing benchmarks
the results show that even by using different data sources for training the proposed pipeline achieves a satisfactory performance
moreover we show that the ranking of entities for question answering can improve the entity ranking
