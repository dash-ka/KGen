ObjectRank is an essential tool to evaluate an importance of nodes for a user-specified query in heterogeneous graphs. However, existing methods are not applicable to massive graphs because they iteratively compute all nodes and edges. This paper proposes SchemaRank, which detects the exact top-k important nodes for a given query within a short running time. SchemaRank dynamically excludes unpromising nodes and edges, ensuring that it detects the same top-k important nodes as ObjectRank. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that the running time of SchemaRank outperforms existing methods by upÂ to two orders of magnitude.
