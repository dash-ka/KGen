objectrank is an essential tool to evaluate an importance of nodes for a userspecified query in heterogeneous graphs
however existing methods are not applicable to massive graphs because existing methods iteratively compute all nodes and edges
this paper proposes schemarank
schemarank which detects the exact topk important nodes for a given query within a short running time
unpromising nodes and edges ensuring that schemarank detects the same topk important nodes as objectrank
schemarank dynamically excludes unpromising nodes and edges
our extensive evaluations demonstrate that the running time of schemarank outperforms existing methods by up to two orders of magnitude
