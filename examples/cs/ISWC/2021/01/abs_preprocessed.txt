Most of the existing structured digital information today is still stored in relational databases
that is why it is important for the Semantic Web effort to expose the information in relational databases as RDF
that is why it is important for the Semantic Web effort to allow to query Semantic Web using SPARQL
RDF that does not require formulating explicit mapping rules 2
RDF that does not require formulating 8
Direct mapping is a fully automated approach for converting wellstructured relational data to RDF
the mapped RDF data
Along with the it is desirable to have a description of that data
OWL axioms which is problematic partly due to the open world semantics of OWL
Previous work 3 has attempted to describe the RDF graph in terms of OWL axioms
8 has attempted to describe the RDF graph in terms of OWL axioms
et al which extends the functionalities of the W3C recommendation
a sourcetotarget semantics preserving rewriting of constraints in an SQL database schema
et al which extends the functionalities of proposal
et al which integrates the functionalities of the W3C recommendation
the direct mapping suggested by Sequeda et al
et al which integrates the functionalities of proposal
We start from the direct mapping and present a sourcetotarget semantics to equivalent SHACL constraints on the RDF graph
the RDF data generated by the direct mapping without the need to perform a costly validation of those constraints on the generated data
We thus provide a SHACL description of the RDF data
Following the approach of We define the rewriting from SQL constraints to SHACL by a set of Datalog rules
We prove that our sourcetotarget is semantics
our sourcetotarget rewriting of constraints
semantics preserving
We prove that our sourcetotarget is constraint preserving
