falsity of facts is addressed by property graphs through the representation of validity making triples occur as firstorder objects in subject position of metadata triples
The first type of error  is addressed by property graphs through the representation of provenance making triples occur as firstorder objects in subject position of metadata triples

The second type of error  has not been addressed with regard to property graphs so far
violation of domain constraints has not been addressed with regard to property graphs so far
In RDF representations this error can be addressed by shape languages such as ShEx
SHACL which allow for checking whether graphs are valid with respect to a set of domain constraints

We define a formal semantics of ProGS investigate the resulting complexity of validating property graphs against sets of ProGS shapes compare with corresponding results for SHACL
