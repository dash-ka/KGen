entailmentbased  OWL reasoning defining a framework
a framework inspired from homogeneous paradigms for integration of rules
DLE  OWL reasoning defining a framework
a framework inspired from the hybrid for integration of rules
We introduce the notion of entailmentbased  OWL reasoning
the mixed DL defining a framework
a framework inspired from the hybrid for integration of ontologies
We introduce the notion of the mixed DL
We introduce the notion of DLE  OWL reasoning
The idea is to combine the scalability of the rule paradigm over large ABoxes
The idea is to combine the TBox inferencing capabilities of the DL algorithms over large ABoxes
Towards this end we define The DLE framework
The DLE framework enhances the entailmentbased OWL reasoning paradigm in two directions
Firstly The DLE framework disengages the manipulation of the TBox semantics from any incomplete entailmentbased approach using the efficient DL algorithms
Secondly The DLE framework achieves faster application of efficient memory usage comparing The DLE framework to the conventional entailmentbased approaches due to the low complexity
Secondly The DLE framework achieves faster application of the ABoxrelated entailments comparing The DLE framework to the conventional entailmentbased approaches due to the low complexity
Secondly The DLE framework achieves faster application of the ABoxrelated entailments comparing The DLE framework to the conventional entailmentbased approaches due to the domainspecific nature of the entailments
