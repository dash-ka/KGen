parametric languageindependent kernel functions defined for individuals within ontologies
a novel family of parametric languageindependent kernel functions is presented
linear classifiers that offer an alternative way to perform classification wrt deductive reasoning
individuals within ontologies are easily integrated with efficient statistical learning methods for inducing linear classifiers
a method for adapting the parameters of the kernel to the knowledge base through stochastic optimization is also proposed
tasks where an inductive approach may bridge the gaps of the standard methods due the inherent incompleteness of the knowledge bases
this enables the exploitation of statistical learning in a variety of tasks
approximate query answering with real ontologies
in this work a system has been tested in experiments on approximate query
real ontologies collected from standard repositories
a system integrating the kernels
