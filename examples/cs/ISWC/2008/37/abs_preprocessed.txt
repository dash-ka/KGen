we present redgraph 
we present the first generic virtual reality visualization program for semantic web data
the first generic virtual reality visualization program for semantic web data is capable of handling large datasets as we demonstrate on social network data from the yous

patent trade office
we develop a semantic web vocabulary of virtual reality terms compatible with graphxml to map graph visualization into the semantic web the semantic web
we approach to visualizing semantic web data takes advantage of userinteraction in an immersive environment to bypass a number of difficult issues in 3dimensional graph visualization layout by relying on users users themselves to interactively extrude the nodes and links of a 2dimensional graph into the third dimension
data formatted according to social network data schema or ontology
when users touch nodes in the virtual reality environment users retrieve data

a user study comparing extrusion vs noextrusion
using this dataset results of a user study are presented
a user study comparing extrusion rrb vs noextrusion rrb
a user study comparing extrusion rrb vs noextrusion rrb
a user study comparing extrusion rrb vs noextrusion rrb
no significant difference was found for broad questions about the overall structure of social network data
a user study comparing extrusion rrb vs noextrusion rrb
a user study showed the use of a extrusion interface by subjects led to significant improvement on answering of finegrained questions about this dataset
furthermore inference can be used to improve the visualization as demonstrated with a dataset of biotechnology patents and researchers
