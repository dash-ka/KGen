we describe rdf123 for translating spreadsheet data to rdf
we describe a highly flexible opensource tool for translating spreadsheet data to rdf
existing spreadsheettordf tools typically map only to starshaped rdf graphs ie each spreadsheet row is an instance with each column
each column representing a property
rdf123 on the other hand allows users to define mappings to arbitrary graphs thus allowing much richer spreadsheet semantics to be expressed
further each row in the spreadsheet can be mapped with a fairly different rdf scheme
two interfaces are available
the first is a graphical application
a graphical application that allows users to create users
users mapping in an intuitive manner
a web service that takes as input a url to a google spreadsheet map
a web service that provides rdf as output
a web service that takes as input a url to csv file map
a web service that takes as input a url to an rdf123 map
the second is a web service
