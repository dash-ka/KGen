A large amount of classes  have been published on the Semantic Web by various parties to be shared for describing resources
A large amount of terms  have been published on the Semantic Web by various parties to be shared for describing resources
A large amount of properties  have been published on the Semantic Web by various parties to be shared for describing resources
Terms are defined based on other terms
a directed dependence relation is formed
The study of term dependence is important for many other tasks such as ontology maintenance
The study of term dependence is important for many other tasks such as distributed reasoning on the Web scale
The study of term dependence is important for many other tasks such as integration
The study of term dependence is a foundation work
In this paper we analyze the complex network characteristics of the term dependence graph
In this paper we analyze the complex network characteristics of the induced vocabulary dependence graph
The graphs are constructed from a large data set that contains 1278233 terms in 3039 vocabularies
The graphs analyzed in the experiments
The results characterize connectivity
The results characterize degree distributions
The results characterize the current status
The results characterize reachability
