we present a technique for answering queries over rdf data through an evolutionary search algorithm using fingerprinting for rapid approximate evaluation of generated solutions
we evolutionary approach has several advantages compared to traditional databasestyle query answering
first the result quality converges with offering  anytime  behaviour with arbitrary tradeoff between computation time in addition the level of approximation can be tuned by varying the size of the bloom filters

first the result quality converges with each evolution with arbitrary tradeoff between query results in addition the level of approximation can be tuned by varying the size of the bloom filters
first the result quality increases monotonically in addition the level of approximation can be tuned by varying the size of the bloom filters

secondly through bloom filter compression we can fit large graphs in main memory reducing the need for disk io during query evaluation
finally since the individuals evolve independently parallel execution is straightforward
