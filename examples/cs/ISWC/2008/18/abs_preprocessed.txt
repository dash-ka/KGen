An approach to improve an RCCderived geospatial approximation is presented which makes use of concept inclusion axioms in OWL
The algorithm used to control the approximation
The algorithm combines hypothesis testing with consistency checking
consistency checking provided by a knowledge representation system based on description logics
Propositions about the consistency of the refined ABox wrt the associated TBox are made
the associated TBox when compared to baseline ABox and TBox
Formal proves of the divergent consistency results when checking either of both are provided
The application of the approach to a geospatial setting results in a roughly tenfold improved approximation
a roughly tenfold improved approximation when using the refined ABox and TBox
Ways to further improve the approximation are discussed
Ways to automate the detection of falsely calculated relations are discussed
