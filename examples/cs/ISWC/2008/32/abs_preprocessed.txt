in this paper we present the proposed framework
ontology modules that can access the knowledge bases of the others through the knowledge bases of the others
within the context of the proposed framework an ontology can be defined and developed as a set of ontology modules welldefined interfaces
an important implication of the proposed framework is that ontology modules can be developed completely independent of each others signature and language
such modules are free to only utilize the required knowledge segments of the others
the interfacebased modular ontology formalism which theoretically supports the proposed framework
we describe the interfacebased modular ontology formalism distinctive features compared to the exiting modular ontology formalisms
the interfacebased modular ontology formalism which theoretically present the proposed framework
we also describe the realworld design and implementation of the proposed framework for modifying the swoop interfaces and reasoners
we also describe the realworld design and implementation of the proposed framework for creating modular ontologies by extending owldl
