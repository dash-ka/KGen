we propose a novel method for reasoning in the description logic shiq
an ordered binary decision diagram which represents a canonical model for t
after a satisfiability is converted into an ordered binary decision diagram
a satisfiability preserving transformation from shiq to the description logic alcib the obtained alcib tbox t
a disjunctive datalog program that can be used for abox reasoning
this an is turned into a disjunctive datalog program
this an ordered binary decision diagram
the algorithm admits easy extensions with dlsafe rules
the algorithm is worstcase optimal wrt data complexity
the algorithm admits easy extensions with ground conjunctive queries
