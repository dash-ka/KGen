We propose a novel method for reasoning in the description logic SHIQ
a satisfiability preserving transformation from SHIQ to the description logic ALCIb the obtained ALCIb Tbox T
After a satisfiability is converted into an ordered binary decision diagram
an ordered binary decision diagram which represents a canonical model for T
a disjunctive datalog program that can be used for Abox reasoning
This an ordered binary decision diagram
This an is turned into a disjunctive datalog program
The algorithm admits easy extensions with DLsafe rules
The algorithm admits easy extensions with ground conjunctive queries
The algorithm is worstcase optimal wrt data complexity
