the ontologies involved
Such approaches however fail to scale with respect to the size of the ontologies
Such approaches however fail to scale with respect to the number of service advertisements
On the other hand this paper presents an scalable indexbased method for the Semantic Web service discovery
the Semantic Web service discovery that allows for fast selection of services at query time
the Semantic Web service discovery that is suitable for both centralized environments
On the other hand this paper presents an efficient indexbased method for the Semantic Web service discovery
the Semantic Web service discovery that is suitable for both P2P environments
We employ a novel encoding of the service descriptions allowing the match between a request and an advertisement to be evaluated in constant time and we index these representations to prune the search space reducing the number of comparisons
comparisons required
better matches are returned first thereby further
Given a desired ranking function the search algorithm can retrieve the topk matches progressively
better matches are computed first thereby further
further reducing the search engines response time
we also show how the search engines can be performed efficiently in a suitable structured P2P overlay network
The benefits of the proposed method are demonstrated through experimental evaluation on both real data
