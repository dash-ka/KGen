humandefined concepts are fundamental buildingblocks in constructing knowledge bases such as ontologies
concept definition driven by data
statistical learning techniques provide an alternative automated approach to concept definition
concept definition driven by prior knowledge
in this paper we propose a probabilistic modeling framework
a probabilistic modeling framework that combines both datadriven topics in a principled manner
a probabilistic modeling framework that combines both humandefined concepts in a principled manner
the methodology we propose is based on applications of statistical topic models  also known as latent dirichlet allocation models 
we demonstrate the utility of this general framework in two ways
we first illustrate how the methodology we propose can be used to automatically tag web pages with concepts from a known set of concepts without any need for labeled documents
we then perform a series of experiments
experiments that quantify how combining humandefined semantic knowledge with datadriven techniques leads to better language models than can be obtained with either alone
