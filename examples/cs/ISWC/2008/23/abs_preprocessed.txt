several ontology repositories provide access to the growing collection of ontologies on the semantic web
some repositories collect ontologies automatically by crawling the semantic web in other repositories users submit ontologies users
in addition to providing search across multiple ontologies the added value of ontology repositories lies in the ontologymapping metadata that users may contain
information provided by ontology authors such as intended use
the ontologymapping metadata may include mapping metadata
the ontologymapping metadata may include feedback
mapping metadata that relates concepts from different ontologies
information provided by ontology authors such as ontologies scope
feedback provided by users such as ontologies experiences in using the ontologies or reviews of the content
the ontologymapping metadata may include information
in this paper we focus on the ontologymapping metadata to collect ontology mappings
in this paper we focus on communitybased method to collect ontology mappings
more specifically we develop a model for representing the metadata
more specifically we develop a model for representing mappings
mappings collected from the user community
the metadata associated with the mapping
we use a model to bring together more than 30000 mappings from 7 sources
upload mappings created with other tools
we also validate a model by extending bioportala repository of biomedical ontologies that we have developed to enable users to create single concepttoconcept mappings in a model graphical user interface to upload mappings to comment on the mappings and to discuss other tools and to visualize the corresponding metadata
