the semantic web is a distributed environment for knowledge representation and reasoning
the distributed nature brings with the semantic web sources between autonomous knowledge bases
the distributed nature brings with the semantic web inconsistencies between autonomous knowledge bases
the semantic web failing data
problems resulting from unavailable sources
to reduce problems caching can be used
to improve performance caching can be used
caches however raise new problems of outdated information
caches however raise new problems of imprecise information
we propose to distinguish between certain information when reasoning on the semantic web by extending the well known four bilattice of knowledge orders to fourc taking into account cached information
we propose to distinguish between cached information when reasoning on the semantic web by extending the well known four bilattice of knowledge orders to fourc taking into account cached information
we propose to distinguish between certain information when reasoning on the semantic web by extending the well known four bilattice of truth orders to fourc taking into account cached information
we propose to distinguish between cached information when reasoning on the semantic web by extending the well known four bilattice of truth orders to fourc taking into account cached information
we discuss how users can be offered additional information about the reliability of inferred information based on the availability of the corresponding information sources
the framework towards fourt allowing for multiple levels of trust on data sources
we then extend the framework towards fourt
in this extended setting knowledge about trust in information sources can be used to compute how well an inferred statement can be trusted
inconsistencies arising from connecting multiple data sources
in this extended setting knowledge about trust in information sources can be used to resolve inconsistencies
we redefine the stable model
trust based reasoning
we founded semantics on the basis of fourt
reformalize the web ontology language owl2 based on logical bilattices to augment owl knowledge bases with trust
