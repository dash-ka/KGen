This paper studies the expressive power of SPARQL
The main result is that nonrecursive safe Datalog with negation have equivalent expressive power
The main result is that SPARQL have equivalent expressive power
hence by classical results SPARQL is equivalent from an expressiveness point of view to Relational Algebra
We present explicit generic rules of the transformations in both directions
Among other findings of This paper are the proof that negation can be simulated in SPARQL that nonsafe filters are superfluous
Among other findings of This paper are the proof that current SPARQL W3C semantics can be simplified to a standard compositional one
