combining multiple ontologies on the Web is bound to lead to inconsistencies between the combined vocabularies
Reusing multiple ontologies on the Web is bound to lead to inconsistencies between the combined vocabularies
the ontologies that are in use today implicit knowledge
Even many of the ontologies turn out to be inconsistent once some of Even many of the ontologies is made explicit
the ontologies that are in use today
However robust methods to deal with inconsistencies are lacking from current Semantic Web reasoning systems
current Semantic Web reasoning systems which are typically based on classical logic
However efficient methods to deal with inconsistencies are lacking from current Semantic Web reasoning systems
In earlier papers we have proposed the use of syntactic relevance functions as a method for reasoning with inconsistent ontologies
In this paper we extend that work to the use of semantic distances
we show how Google distances can be used to develop semantic relevance functions to reason with inconsistent ontologies
In essence we are using the implicit knowledge
the implicit knowledge hidden in the Web for explicit reasoning purposes
we have implemented this approach as part of the PION reasoning system
we report on experiments with several realistic ontologies
The test results show that a mixed syntacticsemantic approach can significantly improve reasoning performance over the purely syntactic approach
Furthermore we methods allow to tradeoff computational cost for inferential completeness
we experiment shows that we only have to give up a little quality to obtain a high performance gain
