Revision of a description logicbased ontology deals with the problem of incorporating newly received information consistently
In this paper we propose a general operator for revising terminologies in description logicbased ontologies
a general operator relies on a reformulation of the kernel contraction operator in belief revision
we first define we revision operator for terminologies
we first show that our revision operator satisfies some desirable logical properties
Second these two algorithms are developed to instantiate a general operator
Since in general these two algorithms are computationally too hard we propose a third algorithm as a more efficient alternative
we provide evaluation results on these two algorithms effectiveness in the context of two application scenarios Incremental ontology learning
we implemented these two algorithms
we provide evaluation results on these two algorithms efficiency in the context of two application scenarios Incremental mapping revision
