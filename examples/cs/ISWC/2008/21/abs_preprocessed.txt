finding mappings between compatible ontologies is an important open problem
finding mappings between compatible ontologies is an difficult open problem
instancebased methods for solving this problem reflect concept semantics as the most active parts of the ontologies are actually being used
instancebased methods for solving this problem have the advantage of focusing on the most active parts of the ontologies
however such methods have not at present been widely investigated in ontology mapping compared to structural techniques
however such methods have not at present been widely investigated in ontology mapping compared to linguistic techniques
furthermore previous instancebased mapping techniques were only applicable to cases vocabularies
furthermore previous instancebased mapping techniques were only applicable to cases with
cases where a substantial set of instances was available that was doubly annotated
in this paper we approach the mapping problem as a classification problem based on the similarity between instances of concepts
this has the advantage that no doubly annotated instances are required so that the method can be applied to any two corpora annotated with two own vocabularies
we evaluate the resulting classifiers on two realworld use cases
we evaluate the resulting classifiers on one with homogeneous
we evaluate the resulting classifiers on one with heterogeneous instances
the results illustrate the efficiency and generality of this method
