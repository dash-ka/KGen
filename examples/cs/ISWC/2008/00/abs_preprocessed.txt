domain experts who should lead The process of providing the relevant conceptual knowledge
The process of authoring ontologies requires the active involvement of domain experts
domain experts who should lead The process of authoring ontologies
However most domain experts lack knowledge modelling skills
However most domain experts find it hard to follow logical notations in OWL
a controlled natural language called Rabbit
This paper presents ROO
a tool that facilitates domain experts definition of ontologies in OWL by allowing domain experts to author the ontology in a controlled natural language
This paper presents a tool
ROO guides users through the ontology construction process by following a methodology geared towards domain experts involvement in ontology authoring
exploiting intelligent user interfaces techniques
An evaluation study has been conducted comparing ROO against another popular ontology authoring tool
hydrology modelling scenarios related to real tasks at the mapping agency of Great Britain
Participants were asked to create ontologies based on hydrology modelling scenarios
environment modelling scenarios related to real tasks at the mapping agency of Great Britain
Participants were asked to create ontologies based on environment modelling scenarios
An evaluation study is discussed focusing on the usability and usefulness of the tool
An evaluation study is discussed focusing on the quality of the resultant ontologies
