Ontology Editing tools are still required to spend time
Controlled Language for Ontology Editing tools offer an attractive alternative for naive users
time learning the correct syntactic structures and vocabulary in order to use the Controlled Language properly
naive users wishing to create ontologies
previous work which uses standard NLP tools to manipulate an ontology
previous work which uses standard NLP tools to process the Controlled Language
This paper extends previous work
Here we also generate text in the Language from an existing ontology  NLG 
an existing ontology using templatebased  Natural Language Generation
an existing ontology using or shallow  Natural Language Generation

an evaluation comparing the RoundTrip Ontology Authoring process with a wellknown ontology editor
Building on previous methodology we undertook an evaluation where previous work required a Language reference manual with several examples in order to use the Controlled Language the use of NLG reduces this
this learning curve for users
Building on previous methodology we undertook an evaluation where previous work required a Language reference manual with several examples in order to use the Controlled Language the use of NLG improves on existing results for basic ontology editing tasks
