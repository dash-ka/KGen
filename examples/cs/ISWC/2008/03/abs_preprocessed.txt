controlled language for ontology editing tools offer an attractive alternative for naive users
time learning the correct syntactic structures and vocabulary in order to use the controlled language properly
ontology editing tools are still required to spend time
naive users wishing to create ontologies
this paper extends previous work
previous work which uses standard nlp tools to process the controlled language
previous work which uses standard nlp tools to manipulate an ontology
here we also generate text in the language from an existing ontology  nlg 
an existing ontology using or shallow  natural language generation
an existing ontology using templatebased  natural language generation
the text generator combine to form a roundtrip ontology authoring environment one can start with an existing imported ontology modify the text as then turn the text back into the ontology in the previous work environment

an evaluation comparing the roundtrip ontology authoring process with a wellknown ontology editor
this learning curve for users
building on previous methodology we undertook an evaluation where previous work required a language reference manual with several examples in order to use the controlled language the use of nlg improves on existing results for basic ontology editing tasks
