we study the problem of distributed rdfs reasoning on top of distributed hash tables
we study the problem of query answering on top of distributed hash tables
scalable distributed rdfs reasoning
scalable is an essential functionality for providing the scalability and performance that largescale semantic web applications require
we goal in this paper is to compare two wellknown approaches to rdfs reasoning forward chaining on top of distributed hash tables
we goal in this paper is to evaluate two wellknown approaches to rdfs reasoning forward chaining on top of distributed hash tables
we goal in this paper is to evaluate two wellknown approaches to rdfs reasoning namely backward on top of distributed hash tables
we goal in this paper is to compare two wellknown approaches to rdfs reasoning namely backward on top of distributed hash tables
we show how to prove bamboo correctness
we show how to implement both the algorithms
we also study the timespace tradeoff experimentally by evaluating we algorithms on planetlab
we also study the timespace tradeoff exhibited by the algorithms analytically
