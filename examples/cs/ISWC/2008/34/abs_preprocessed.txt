The emerging paradigm of serviceoriented computing requires novel techniques for various servicerelated tasks
Along with automated support for service discovery selection support for automated service contracting and enactment is crucial for any large scale service environment
any large scale service environment where large numbers of service providers interact
Along with automated support for service discovery negotiation support for automated service contracting and enactment is crucial for any large scale service environment
Along with automated support for service discovery composition support for automated service contracting and enactment is crucial for any large scale service environment
any large scale service environment where large numbers of clients interact
a number of logicbased methods to handle Many problems in this area have emerged in the field of Semantic Web Services
Many problems in this area involve reasoning
In this paper we build upon we previous work
previous work where we used Concurrent Transaction Logic to model about service contracts
previous work where we used Concurrent Transaction Logic to reason about service contracts
we significantly extend the modeling power of the previous work by allowing iterative processes in the specification of service contracts
we extend the proof theory of Concurrent Transaction Logic to enable reasoning about such contracts
With this extension we logicbased approach is capable of modeling general services
modeling general services represented using languages such as WSBPEL
