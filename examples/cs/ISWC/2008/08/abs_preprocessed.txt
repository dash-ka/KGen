a modelling paradigm that is especially well suited for developing models of large structurally complex domains such as those
the web ontology language provides a modelling paradigm
those found in the life sciences
the web ontology languages declarative nature combined with powerful reasoning tools has effectively supported the development of disease
the web ontology languages declarative nature combined with powerful reasoning tools has effectively supported the development of clinical ontologies
the web ontology languages declarative nature combined with powerful reasoning tools has effectively supported the development of very large and complex anatomy
the web ontology language however is not a programming language so using these models in applications necessitates both a technical means of integrating the web ontology language models with programs in knowing how to integrate the web ontology language models
the web ontology language however is not a programming language so using these models in applications necessitates both a technical means of integrating the web ontology language models with considerable methodological sophistication in knowing how to integrate the web ontology language models
in this paper we present an analytical framework for evaluating various owljava combination approaches
hybrid modelling building models in which part of the model exists
hybrid modelling that is
hybrid modelling building models in which part of the model is developed directly in the web ontology language
we have developed a software framework for what we call hybrid modelling
hybrid modelling building models in which part of the model is developed directly in java
hybrid modelling building models in which part of the model exists
we analyse the advantages and disadvantages of hybrid modelling both by means of a case study of a large medical records system
we analyse the advantages and disadvantages of hybrid modelling both in comparison to other approaches
