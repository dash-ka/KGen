subsequent semantic modelling of two popular social networking sites interests utilising Wikipedia as a multidomain model
subsequent semantic modelling of two popular social networking sites interests
we present a method for the automatic consolidation of user profiles across two popular social networking sites
We evaluate in which domains the knowledge is focussed
domains the knowledge acquired
We evaluate how much can be learned from such sites
users when multiple tagclouds are combined
Results show that far richer interest profiles can be generated for users
