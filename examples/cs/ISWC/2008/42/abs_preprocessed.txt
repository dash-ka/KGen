ontologies which considers especially the object properties between the concepts
this paper presents a new semantic relatedness measure on ontologies
our approach relies on two hypotheses
firstly using only concept hierarchy only a few paths can be considered as  semantically corrects  and these paths obey to a given set of rules
firstly using only object properties only a few paths can be considered as  semantically corrects  and these paths obey to a given set of rules
a cost  represented as a weight  which depends on a given edge in isa partof 
a cost  represented as a weight  which depends on a given edge in a path position in a path
a cost  represented as a weight  which depends on a given edge in a path type 
a cost  represented as a weight  which depends on a given edge in a path context in the ontology
secondly following a given edge in a path has a cost  represented as a weight 
the lexical base wordnet using partof relation with two different benchmarks
we propose an evaluation of we measure on the lexical base wordnet
we show that in this context our measure outperforms the classical semantic measures
