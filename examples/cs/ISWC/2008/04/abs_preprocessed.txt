navigational features have been largely recognized as fundamental for graph database query languages
this fact has motivated several authors to propose rdf query languages with navigational capabilities
in particular
we have argued in a previous paper that nested regular expressions are appropriate to navigate rdf data
we have proposed the nsparql query language for rdf
rdf that uses nested regular expressions as building blocks
in a previous paper that nested regular expressions are appropriate to navigate rdf data we study some of the fundamental properties of nsparql concerning complexity of evaluation
in a previous paper that nested regular expressions are appropriate to navigate rdf data we study some of the fundamental properties of nsparql concerning expressiveness of evaluation
regarding expressiveness we show that nsparql is expressive enough to answer queries
queries considering the semantics of the rdfs vocabulary by directly traversing the input graph
we study the expressiveness of the combination of nested regular expressions
we study the expressiveness of the combination of sparql operators
we also show that nesting is necessary to obtain this last result
regarding complexity of evaluation we prove that the evaluation of a nested regular expression e over an rdf graph g can be computed in time o
