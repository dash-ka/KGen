the growing popularity of social tagging systems promises to alleviate the knowledge bottleneck since social tagging systems allow ordinary users to create knowledge in a simple cheap representation usually known as folksonomy

the growing popularity of social tagging systems promises to alleviate the knowledge bottleneck since social tagging systems allow ordinary users to share knowledge in a simple scalable representation usually known as folksonomy
the growing popularity of social tagging systems promises to alleviate the knowledge bottleneck since social tagging systems allow ordinary users to create knowledge in a simple scalable representation usually known as folksonomy
the knowledge bottleneck that slows down the full materialization of the semantic web
however for the sake of knowledge workflow one needs to find a compromise between the controlled vocabulary of domain experts
however for the sake of knowledge workflow one needs to find a compromise between the uncontrolled nature of folksonomies
however for the sake of knowledge workflow one needs to find a compromise between the more systematic vocabulary of domain experts
in this paper we propose to address this concern by introducing a novel algorithm based on frequent itemset mining techniques to efficiently learn an ontology over the enriched folksonomy
in this paper we propose to address this concern by devising a method to efficiently learn an ontology over the enriched folksonomy
a method that automatically enriches a folksonomy with domain expert knowledge
in order to quantitatively assess our method we propose a new benchmark for taskbased ontology evaluation where the quality of the ontologies is measured based on how helpful the ontologies are for the task of personalized information finding
we conduct experiments on real data
we show the effectiveness of we approach
