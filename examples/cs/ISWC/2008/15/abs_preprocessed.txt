there are many reasons for measuring a distance between ontologies
in particular it is useful to know quickly if two ontologies are close or remote before deciding to match two ontologies
to that extent a distance between ontologies must be quickly computable
constraints applying to several possible ontology distances
constraints applying to such measures
we present constraints
then we evaluate experimentally some of several possible ontology distances in order to assess some of speed
then we evaluate experimentally some of such measures in order to assess some of them accuracy
