this paper describes the first steps towards developing a methodology for testing
this paper describes the first steps towards evaluating the performance of reasoners for the probabilistic description logic pshiq
since this paper is a new formalism for handling uncertainty in dl ontologies no such methodology has been proposed
there are no sufficiently large probabilistic ontologies to be used as test suites
in addition since the reasoning services in pshiq are mostly query oriented there is no single problem  like classification in classical dl 
no single problem  like realization in classical dl  that could be an obvious candidate for benchmarking

all these issues make it hard to evaluate the performance of reasoners
all these issues make it hard to reveal the complexity bottlenecks
all these issues make it hard to assess the value of optimization strategies
this paper addresses these important problems by making the following contributions this paper addresses describes a probabilistic ontology
breast cancer which poses significant challenges for the stateofart pshiq reasoners
this paper addresses these important problems by making the following contributions first describes a probabilistic ontology
a probabilistic ontology that has been developed for the reallife domain of breast cancer
she would light on what makes reasoning in pshiq hard in practice
second
this paper addresses explains a systematic approach to generating a series of probabilistic reasoning problems
probabilistic reasoning problems that enable evaluation of the reasoning performance
finally this paper presents an
an optimized algorithm for the nonmonotonic entailment
this paper positive impact on performance is demonstrated using our evaluation methodology
