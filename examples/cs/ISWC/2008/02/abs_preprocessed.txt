In order to make good use of an ontology especially a complex ontology we need methods to help understand methods first
In order to make good use of an ontology especially a new ontology we need methods to help understand methods first
Identifying potentially important concepts and relations in an ontology is an challenging method
Identifying potentially important concepts and relations in an ontology is an intuitive method
In this paper we first define four features for potentially important concepts and relation from the ontological structural point of view
Then a simple yet effective ConceptAndRelationRanking algorithm is proposed to simultaneously rank the importance of concepts
Then a simple yet effective ConceptAndRelationRanking algorithm is proposed to simultaneously rank the importance of relations
Different from the weights of relations reinforce one another in simple yet effective ConceptAndRelationRanking in an iterative manner
Different from the importance of concepts reinforce one another in simple yet effective ConceptAndRelationRanking in an iterative manner
Different from the traditional ranking methods reinforce one another in simple yet effective ConceptAndRelationRanking in an iterative manner
Such an iterative process is proved to be convergent both by experiments
Such an iterative process is proved to be convergent both in principle
we experimental results show that simple yet effective ConceptAndRelationRanking has a similar convergent speed as the PageRanklike algorithms
we experimental results show that simple yet effective ConceptAndRelationRanking has a similar convergent speed as a more reasonable ranking result
