systems in which users can annotate items
The emergence of web raises the question of the semantic interoperability between vocabularies
web based systems
vocabularies originating from often called folksonomies
vocabularies originating from keywords
keywords assigned in a more traditional way
vocabularies originating from collaborative annotation processes
instance based mapping between the vocabularies
If collections are annotated according to two systems eg with keywords the annotated data can be used for instance
If collections are annotated according to two systems eg with tags the annotated data can be used for instance
concepts based on this kind of matching distribution as annotations
The basis for this kind of matching is an appropriate similarity measure between concepts
In this paper we propose a new similarity measure generated metadata
a new similarity measure that can take advantage of some special properties of user
Wikipedia which are both annotated by users of the bookmarking service delicious
we have evaluated a new similarity measure
Wikipedia which are both classified according to the topic structure of Wikipedia
a new similarity measure that can take advantage of some special properties of user with a set of articles from Wikipedia
The results are significantly better than those
a new similarity measure that can take advantage of some special properties of user
those obtained using standard similarity measures
standard similarity measures proposed for this task in the literature
this task in the literature correlates better with human judgments
The results using a new similarity measure
a new similarity measure that can take advantage of some special properties of user
We argue that a new similarity measure also has benefits for instance
instance based mapping of more traditionally developed vocabularies
