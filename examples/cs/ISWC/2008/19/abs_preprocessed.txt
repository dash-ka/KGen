we discuss certain nontrivial consequences of the datatype system of owl such as the extensibility of the set of supported datatypes and complexity of reasoning
we analyze the datatype system of owl
we analyze the datatype system of owl 2
we discuss certain nontrivial consequences of the datatype system of owl 2 definition such as the extensibility of the set of supported datatypes and complexity of reasoning
we also argue that certain datatypes from the list of normative datatypes in the current owl 2 are inappropriate
the current owl 2 working draft
we also argue that certain datatypes from the list of normative datatypes in the current owl 2 should be replaced with different ones
finally we present an algorithm for datatype reasoning
an algorithm for datatype reasoning is modular in the sense that an algorithm for datatype reasoning can handle any datatype
any datatype that supports certain basic operations
we show how to implement certain basic operations for string datatypes
we show how to implement certain basic operations for number datatypes
