novel techniques which allow for efficient querying of large expressive knowledge bases in secondary storage
we present novel techniques
grounded conjunctive query answering over owldl ontologies is intractable in the worst case
in particular we show that we can effectively answer grounded conjunctive queries without building a full completion forest for a large abox  unlike state of the art tableau reasoners 
instead we rely on the completion forest of a dramatically reduced summary of a large abox
we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in aboxes with up to 45 million assertions
