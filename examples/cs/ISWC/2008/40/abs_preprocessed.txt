we introduce extelp as a decidable fragment of the semantic web rule language
the semantic web rule language that admits reasoning in polynomial time
extelp encompasses an extended notion of the recently proposed dl rules for that logic
extelp is based on the tractable description logic el
features introduced by the forthcoming owl 2 such as local reflexivity
features introduced by the forthcoming owl 2 such as certain range restrictions
thus extelp extends el with a number of features
features introduced by the forthcoming owl 2 such as disjoint roles
features introduced by the forthcoming owl 2 such as the universal role
we present a reasoning algorithm based on a translation of extelp to datalog
a translation of extelp to datalog also enables the seamless integration of dlsafe rules into extelp
the description logic programming fragment of owl 2
while reasoning with dlsafe rules as such is already highly intractable we show that dlsafe rules can be admitted in extelp without losing tractability
dlsafe rules based on the description logic
