the ontology that is sufficient for an entailment in an owl ontology to hold
a justification for an entailment in an owl ontology is a minimal subset of the ontology
since justifications respect the syntactic form of axioms in an ontology syntactically nor semantically minimal
since justifications respect the syntactic form of axioms in they are usually neither syntactically nor semantically minimal
this paper presents two new subclasses of justifications laconic justifications
this paper presents two new subclasses of justifications precise justifications
axioms that do not contain any superfluous  parts
laconic justifications only consist of axioms 
precise justifications can be derived from laconic justifications
precise justifications are characterised by the fact that precise justifications consist of flat small axioms
flat small axioms which facilitate the generation of semantically minimal repairs
formal definitions for both types of justification are presented
in contrast to previous work in this area formal definitions for both types of justification make it clear as to what exactly  parts of axioms  are
in order to demonstrate the practicability of computing laconic justifications an algorithm results from an empirical evaluation carried out on several published ontologies are presented

ontologies that vary in complexity
an empirical evaluation showed that laconicprecise justifications can be computed in a reasonable time for entailments in a range of ontologies
ontologies that vary in size
entailments that had more laconicprecise justifications than regular justifications
it was found that in half of the ontologies sampled there were entailments
more surprisingly it was observed that for some ontologies there were fewer laconic justifications than regular justifications
