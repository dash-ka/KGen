collaborative tagging systems have nowadays become important data sources for populating semantic web applications
for tasks like synonym detection and discovery of concept hierarchies many researchers introduced these measures
even though most of these measures appear very natural most of these measures design often seems to be rather ad hoc
the underlying assumptions on the notion of similarity are not made explicit
validation of tag similarity in terms of formal representations of knowledge is still lacking
a more systematic characterization is still lacking
here we address this issue each measure is computed on data from the social bookmarking system delicious
here we analyze several measures of tag similarity each measure is computed on data from the social bookmarking system delicious

here we address this issue a semantic grounding is provided by mapping pairs of similar tags in the folksonomy to pairs of synsets in wordnet where we use validated measures of semantic distance to characterize the semantic relation between the

this exposes important features of the investigated similarity measures
this indicates which ones are better suited in the context of a given semantic application
