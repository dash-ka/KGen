correspondences in ontology alignments relate two ontology entities with a relation
typical relations are equivalence
typical relations are subsumption
however different systems may need different kinds of relations
we propose to use the concepts of algebra of relations in order to express the relations between ontology entities in a general way
we show the benefits in doing so in expressing disjunctive relations
we show the benefits in amalgamating alignments with relations of different granularity
we show the benefits in composing alignments
we show the benefits in merging alignments in different ways
