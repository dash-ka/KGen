Efficient RDF data management is one of the cornerstones in realizing the Semantic Web vision
In the past different RDF storage strategies have been proposed ranging from simple triple stores to vertical partitioning on the predicates
In the past different RDF storage strategies have been proposed ranging from simple triple stores to more advanced techniques like clustering
We present an experimental comparison of existing storage strategies on top of the SP2Bench SPARQL performance benchmark suite
We put the results into context by comparing the results to a purely relational model of the benchmark scenario
We observe that in terms of scalability a simple triple store is competitive to the vertically partitioned approach scenario with realworld queries none of the approaches scales to documents containing tens of millions of RDF triples
approach when choosing a predicate subject object  sort order in We
We observe that in terms of performance a simple triple store is competitive to the vertically partitioned approach scenario with realworld queries none of the approaches scales to documents containing tens of millions of RDF triples
approach when choosing a physical  sort order in We
We observe that none of the approaches can compete with a purely relational model
a simple triple store built on top of a columnstore DBMS
We conclude that future research is necessary to further bring forward RDF data management
