Currently proposed Semantic Web Services technologies allow the creation of ontologybased semantic annotations of Web services so that software agents are able to discover invoke monitor Web services with a high degree of automation

The OWL Services ontology is an upper ontology in OWL language providing essential vocabularies to semantically describe Web services
Currently OWL Services services can only be developed independently if one service is unavailable then finding a suitable alternative would require an difficult global searchmatch

It is desirable to have a new OWL Services construct
substitution tracing as well as reuse of services
substitution tracing as well as incremental development
a new OWL Services construct that can systematically support substitution
Introducing inheritance relationship into OWL Services is a natural solution
However most of the other currently discussed formalisms for Semantic Web Services such as WSMO has yet to define a selfcontained mechanism of establishing inheritance relationships among services

In this paper we extend OWL Services with the ability to maintain inheritance relationships between services

Through the definition of an additional  inheritance profile  inheritance relationships can be reasoned about

Two types of IRs are allowed to grant service developers the choice to respect the  contract  between not

the prototype will be briefly evaluated as well
The proposed inheritance framework has also been implemented
