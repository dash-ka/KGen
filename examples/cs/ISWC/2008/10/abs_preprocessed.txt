the owl services ontology is an upper ontology in owl language providing essential vocabularies to semantically describe web services
currently owl services services can only be developed independently if one service is unavailable then finding a suitable alternative would require an difficult global searchmatch

substitution tracing as well as incremental development
substitution tracing as well as reuse of services
a new owl services construct that can systematically support substitution
it is desirable to have a new owl services construct
introducing inheritance relationship into owl services is a natural solution
however most of the other currently discussed formalisms for semantic web services such as wsmo has yet to define human organization of services into a taxonomylike structure
however most of the other currently discussed formalisms for semantic web services such as sawsdl has yet to define a selfcontained mechanism of establishing inheritance relationships among services

in this paper we extend owl services with the ability to define inheritance relationships between services
in this paper we extend owl services with the ability to maintain inheritance relationships between services
through the definition of an additional  inheritance profile  inheritance relationships can be stated about
through the definition of an additional  inheritance profile  inheritance relationships can be reasoned about
two types of irs are allowed to grant service developers the choice to respect the  contract  between not
two types of irs are allowed to grant service developers the choice to respect the  contract  between services
the prototype will be briefly evaluated as well
the proposed inheritance framework has also been implemented
