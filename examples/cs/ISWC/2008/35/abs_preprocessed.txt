Integration of heterogeneous services is often hardwired in workflow implementations
Integration of heterogeneous services is often hardwired in service implementations
services allowing flexible integration of services with solving data where necessary
services allowing flexible integration of services with solving process conflicts where necessary
In this paper we define an execution model operating on semantic descriptions of services
we implement the model
the model using we WSMO a case scenario from the B2B domain of the SWS Challenge
