the profile based service signature matching
various semantic web service discovery techniques have been proposed many of which perform the profile
however the service service signature concepts are not sufficient to discover web services accurately
this paper presents a new method to enhance the semantic description of semantic web service by using the semantic constraints of service service signature concepts in specific context
the semantic constraints are extracted automatically from the parsing results of the service description text by a set of heuristic rules
the semantic constraints described in a constraint graph
a constraint graph based matchmaking algorithm
the corresponding semantic web service matchmaker performs not only the profiles semantic matching with the help of a constraint graph
the corresponding semantic web service matchmaker performs the matching of the corresponding semantic web service matchmaker semantic constraints with the help of a constraint graph
the experiment results are encouraging when applying the semantic constraint to discover semantic web services on the service retrieval test collection owlstc v2
