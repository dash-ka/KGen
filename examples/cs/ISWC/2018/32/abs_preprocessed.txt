dealing with large tabular datasets often requires extensive preprocessing
this preprocessing happens only once so that loading the data in a database may be an overkill
this preprocessing happens only once so that indexing the data in a database may be an overkill
this preprocessing happens only once so that loading the data in triple store may be an overkill
this preprocessing happens only once so that indexing the data in triple store may be an overkill
in this paper we present an approach
an approach that allows preprocessing large tabular data in datalog without indexing the data
the datalog query is translated to unix bash
the datalog query can be executed in a she will
we experiments show that for the use case of data preprocessing we approach is competitive with stateoftheart systems in terms of speed while at the same time she will on a unix system
the same time requiring only a bash
we experiments show that for the use case of data preprocessing we approach is competitive with stateoftheart systems in terms of scalability while at the same time she will on a unix system
