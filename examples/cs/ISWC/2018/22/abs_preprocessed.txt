In the absence of a central naming authority on the Semantic Web it is common for different datasets to refer to the same thing by different IRIs
Whenever multiple names are used to denote the same thing  sameAs statements are needed in order to link the data
Whenever multiple names are used to denote owl sameAs statements are needed in order to link the data
Whenever multiple names are used to denote owl sameAs statements are needed in order to link foster reuse
Whenever multiple names are used to denote the same thing  sameAs statements are needed in order to link foster reuse
Studies have observed that sameAs property is sometimes used incorrectly
Studies have observed that the owl is sometimes used incorrectly
Studies that date back as far as 2009
In this paper we show how network metrics such as the community structure of the owl sameAs property sameAs graph can be used in order to detect such possibly erroneous statements
One benefit of the here presented approach is that the here presented approach can be applied to the network of owl sameAs does not rely on any additional knowledge
One benefit of the here presented approach is that the here presented approach can be applied to the network of owl sameAs links the here presented approach
In order to illustrate the here presented approach ability to scale the approach is evaluated on the largest collection of identity links to date containing over 558M owl sameAs links scraped from the LOD Cloud
