Named Entity Recognition and Typing is a challenging task especially with longtail entities such as the ones
the ones found in scientific publications
longtail entities such as the ones are rare often relevant only in specific knowledge domains yet important for retrieval purposes
longtail entities such as the ones are rare often relevant only in specific knowledge domains yet important for exploration purposes
supervised machine learning models
Stateoftheart NER approaches employ supervised machine
models trained on expensive typelabeled data laboriously produced by human annotators
A common workaround is the generation of labeled training data from knowledge bases this approach is not suitable for longtail entity types
longtail entity types that are by definition scarcely represented in KBs
This paper presents an iterative approach for training NER in scientific publications
This paper presents an iterative approach for NET classifiers in scientific publications
scientific publications that relies on minimal human input namely a small seed set of instances for the targeted entity type
We introduce different strategies for training data extraction semantic expansion
We result entity filtering
We evaluate We approach on scientific publications focusing on Methods in computer science publications
We evaluate We approach on scientific publications focusing on the longtail entities types Datasets
We evaluate We approach on scientific publications focusing on Proteins in biomedical publications
