We develop a declarative framework for privacypreserving Linked Data publishing in which privacy policies are specified as SPARQL queries
We approach leads to inspect utility policies in order to determine the sequence of anonymization operations applicable to any graph instance for satisfying the policies
We approach is dataindependent
We approach leads to inspect only the privacy in order to determine the sequence of anonymization operations applicable to any graph instance for satisfying the policies
We gauge our algorithms performance through experiments
We prove the soundness of We algorithms
