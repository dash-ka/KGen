we present we approach based on distant supervision
we present we approach automatically extracted lexicons to identify recipes in digitised historical newspapers to generate recipe tags
we provide ocr quality indicators
we provide ocr quality indicators impact on the extraction process
we enrich the recipes with links to information on the ingredients
we research shows how machine learning can be combined to construct a rich dataset from heterogeneous newspapers for the historical analysis of food culture
we research shows how natural language processing can be combined to construct a rich dataset from heterogeneous newspapers for the historical analysis of food culture
we research shows how semantic web can be combined to construct a rich dataset from heterogeneous newspapers for the historical analysis of food culture
