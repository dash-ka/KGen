We present We approach automatically extracted lexicons to identify recipes in digitised historical newspapers to extract ingredient information
We present We approach automatically extracted lexicons to identify recipes in digitised historical newspapers to generate recipe tags
We provide OCR quality indicators impact on the extraction process
We provide OCR quality indicators
We enrich the recipes with links to information on the ingredients
