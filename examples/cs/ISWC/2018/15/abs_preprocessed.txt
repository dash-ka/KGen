ontology summarization aspires to produce an abridged version of the original data source highlighting ontology summarization most important concepts
however in an ideal scenario the user should not be limited only to static summaries
the data source requesting more detailed information for a particular part of more detailed information
starting from the summary she should be able to further explore the data source
a new approach enabling the dynamic exploration of summaries through two novel operations extend
in this paper we present a new approach
a new approach enabling the dynamic exploration of summaries through two novel operations zoom
extend focuses on a specific subgraph of the initial summary whereas zoom on the whole graph
extend providing granular information access to the enduser
we show that calculating these operators is npcomplete
we provide approximations for these operators calculation
more queries focusing on specific nodes whereas using global zoom we can answer overall more queries
then we show that using extend we can answer more queries
finally we show that the algorithms can efficiently approximate both operators
the algorithms employed
