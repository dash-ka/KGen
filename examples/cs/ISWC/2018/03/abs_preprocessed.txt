Knowledge Graphs are widely used abstractions to represent entitycentric knowledge
these approaches have become increasingly popular for these approaches ability to capture support other reasoning tasks
these approaches have become increasingly popular for these approaches ability to capture the similarity between entities
However representation of time has received little attention in these approaches
vectorbased entity representations using a textbased Knowledge Graphs embedding model
In this work we make a first step to encode time into vectorbased entity representations
a textbased Knowledge Graphs embedding model named Typed Entity Embeddings
In Typed Entity Embeddings each entity is represented by a vector
a vector that represents the entity type mentions found in a text corpus
a vector that represents the entity mentions found in a text corpus
the entity type which is learned from entity
Inspired by evidence from cognitive sciences we propose an approach to encode representations of years into Typed Entity Embeddings by aggregating the representations of the entities
Inspired by evidence from applicationoriented concerns we propose an approach to encode representations of years into Typed Entity Embeddings by aggregating the representations of the entities
the entities that occur in eventbased descriptions of the years
the representations of the entities are used to define two timeaware similarity measures to control the implicit effect of time on entity similarity
the entities that occur in eventbased descriptions of the years
the timeaware similarity measure proposed to flatten the time effect on entity similarity
Experimental results show that the linear order of years is highly correlated with natural time flow
years obtained using our model
Experimental results show that the linear order of years is highly correlated with the effectiveness of the timeaware similarity measure
