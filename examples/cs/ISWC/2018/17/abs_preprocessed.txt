faceted browsing has also been investigated in rdf
faceted browsing has become a popular paradigm for user interfaces on the web
however current faceted browsers for rdf graphs encounter performance issues
performance issues when faced with two challenges
heterogeneity where large numbers of classes generate many facets
however current faceted browsers for rdf graphs encounter scale
however current faceted browsers for rdf graphs encounter heterogeneity
scale where large datasets generate many results
heterogeneity where large numbers of properties generate many facets
heterogeneous largescale rdf graphs based on a materialisation strategy
to address two challenges we propose a faceted browsing system for heterogeneous largescale rdf graphs
possible facet combinations that are candidates for indexing
to address two challenges we propose grafa
a materialisation strategy that performs an offline analysis of the input graph in order to identify a subset of the exponential number of possible facet combinations
in experiments over wikidata we demonstrate that materialisation allows for displaying faceted views over millions of diverse results in under a second while keeping index sizes relatively small
we also present initial usability studies over grafa
