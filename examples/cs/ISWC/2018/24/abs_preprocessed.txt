We give an operational semantics to the ontology via a rule language
We present an ontology for representing workflows over components with ReadWrite Linked Data interfaces
Workflow languages have been successfully applied for modelling behaviour in enterprise information systems
enterprise information systems in which the data is often managed in a relational database
Things in which application behaviour is often specified using imperative programming languages
Linked Data interfaces have been widely deployed on the web to support data integration in very diverse domains increasingly also in scenarios
scenarios involving the Internet of Things
Linked Data which allows for decentralised data publication
Linked Data which integrated data access
With We work We aim to combine workflow languages which allow for the highlevel specification of application behaviour by nonexpert users with Linked Data
pilots carrying out tasks in a virtual reality aircraft cockpit
We show that We ontology is expressive enough to cover the basic workflow patterns
a prototype system that observes pilots
We demonstrate the applicability of We approach with a prototype system
On a synthetic benchmark from the building automation domain the runtime scales linearly with the size of the number of Internet of Things devices
