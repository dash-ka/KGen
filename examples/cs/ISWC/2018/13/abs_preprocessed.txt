An important problem that must be solved to provide situational awareness to aid providers
An important problem is automatic clustering of subevents
subevents that refer to the same underlying event
An effective solution to An important problem requires judicious use of both domainspecific information
An effective solution to An important problem requires judicious use of both semantic information
An important problem that must be solved to provide situational awareness to aid providers
An effective solution to An important problem requires judicious use of statistical methods like deep neural embeddings
Augmented feature sets for Structured Event Entity Resolution that combines advances in deep neural embeddings both on text data with minimally supervised inputs from domain experts
Augmented feature sets for Structured Event Entity Resolution that combines advances in deep neural embeddings both on graph data with minimally supervised inputs from domain experts
In this paper we present an approach Augmented feature sets for Structured Event Entity Resolution
Structured batch scenarios
Structured Event Entity Resolution can operate in both online
On five realworld Disaster Relief datasets Event Entity Resolution is found on average to outperform the next best baseline result by almost 15percent on the cluster purity metric on the F1Measure metric
On five realworld Disaster Relief datasets Event Entity Resolution is found on average to outperform the next best baseline result by almost 15percent on the cluster purity by 3percent on the F1Measure metric

In contrast textbased approaches are found to perform poorly demonstrating the importance of semantic information in devising a good solution
We also use subevent clustering visualizations to illustrate the qualitative potential of Structured Event Entity Resolution
