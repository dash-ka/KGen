Many citizens nowadays flock to social media during crises to acquire the latest information about the event
Many citizens nowadays flock to social media during crises to share the latest information about the event
the posts that are truly relevant to the crisis
Due to the sheer volume of data typically circulated during such events it is necessary to be able to efficiently filter out irrelevant posts thus focusing attention on the posts
Current methods for classifying the relevance of posts to a crisis or set of crises typically struggle to deal with posts in different languages
Current methods for classifying the relevance of posts to a crisis or set of crises is not viable during rapidly evolving crisis situations to train new models for each language
In this paper we test semantic classification approaches on crosslingual datasets from 30 crisis events consisting of posts
In this paper we test statistical classification approaches on crosslingual datasets from 30 crisis events consisting of posts
In this paper we test statistical classification approaches on crosslingual datasets from 30 crisis events Italian
In this paper we test semantic classification approaches on crosslingual datasets from 30 crisis events Italian
posts written mainly in English Spanish
we experiment with scenarios where the model is tested on another
we experiment with scenarios where the data is translated to a single language
we experiment with scenarios where the model is trained on one language
we show that the addition of semantic features improve accuracy over a purely statistical model
semantic features extracted from external knowledge bases
