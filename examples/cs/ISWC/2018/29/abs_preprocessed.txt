the lod cloud offers a plethora of rdf data sources where users discover items of interest by issuing sparql queries
a sparql query that returns nothing how to refine the query to obtain a nonempty set
a common query problem for users is to face with empty answers given a sparql query
in this paper we propose an rdf graph embedding
an rdf graph embedding based framework to solve the sparql emptyanswer problem in terms of a continuous vector space
a continuous vector space by an entity context preserving translational embedding model
translational embedding model which is specially designed for sparql queries
we first project the rdf graph into a continuous vector space by an entity context
a sparql query that returns an empty set we partition an empty set into several parts
a sparql query that compute approximate answers by leveraging rdf embeddings
a sparql query that compute approximate answers by leveraging the translation mechanism
then given a sparql query
returned answers which helps users recognize users expectations
returned answers which helps users refine the original query finally
we also generate alternative queries for returned answers
to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework our conduct extensive experiments on the realworld rdf dataset
the results show that our framework can significantly improve the quality of approximate answers
the results show that our framework can significantly speed up the generation of alternative queries
