In this paper we present a Probabilistic Soft Logic model mentions
a Probabilistic Soft Logic model that leverages ontological entity classes to relate NLP annotations from different tasks
different tasks insisting on the same entity
The intuition behind a Probabilistic Soft Logic RRB model is that an annotation likely implies some ontological classes on the entity
annotations from different tasks on the same mention have to share more the same implied entity classes
annotations from different tasks on the same mention have to share less the same implied entity classes
the entity identified by the same mention
