information extraction refers to automatically extracting structured relation tuples from unstructured texts
relation extraction are severely restricted by limited relation types
common information extraction solutions are severely restricted by informal relation specifications
open information extraction systems can hardly handle crosssentence tuples

qa4ie which leverages the flexible question
a novel information extraction framework named qa4ie
in order to overcome these weaknesses we propose a novel information extraction framework
the flexible question answering approaches to produce high quality relation triples across sentences
based on a novel information extraction framework we develop a large information extraction benchmark with high quality human evaluation
qa4ie which leverages the flexible question answering rrb approaches to produce high quality relation triples across sentences

this benchmark contains 293k documents
this benchmark contains 636 relation types
this benchmark contains 2m golden relation triples
the results show that our system achieves great improvements
we compare we system with some information extraction baselines on we benchmark
