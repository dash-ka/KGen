Cloudbased systems provide a rich platform for managing largescale RDF data
RDF queries that involve multiple join operations
However the distributed nature of Cloudbased systems introduces several performance challenges especially for RDF queries
To alleviate these challenges this paper studies the effect of several optimization techniques
several optimization techniques that enhance the performance of RDF queries
intermediate results that are common for certain
Based on the query workload reduced sets of intermediate results join patterns are computed
an online fashion using Bloom filters
Furthermore these reductions are not computed beforehand
Furthermore these reductions are rather computed only for the frequent join patterns in an online fashion
multiple queries that share the same join patterns
Rather than caching the final results of each query we show that caching these reductions allows reusing intermediate results across multiple queries
In addition we introduce an efficient solution for RDF queries with unbound properties
