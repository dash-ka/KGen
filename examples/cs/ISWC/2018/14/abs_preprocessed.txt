facts stored in a knowledge graph
we address the problem of finding descriptive explanations of facts
this is important in highrisk domains such as healthcare intelligence where machinelearned systems extract facts from an input corpus is opaque to the enduser
intelligence where users need additional information for decision making
this is important in highrisk domains such as healthcare intelligence where working of the extractors is opaque to the enduser
applications that rely on automatically constructed knowledge graphs
intelligence where users is especially crucial for applications
a simple yet effective and efficient solution that takes into account passage level to produce a ranked list of passages
we follow an approach propose a simple yet effective and efficient solution
passages describing a given input relation
