facts stored in a knowledge graph
We address the problem of finding descriptive explanations of facts
applications that rely on automatically constructed knowledge graphs
This is important in highrisk domains such as healthcare intelligence where machinelearned systems extract facts from an input corpus is opaque to the enduser
intelligence where users need additional information for decision making
intelligence where users is especially crucial for applications
This is important in highrisk domains such as healthcare intelligence where working of the extractors is opaque to the enduser
