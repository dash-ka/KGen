This paper addresses the problem of fake news detection
There are many works already in this space however most of many works are using news content for the decision making
There are many works already in this space however most of many works are for social media
news content using knowledge graphs
In This paper we propose some novel approaches including the BTransE model to detecting fake news based on news content
In our solutions our need to address a few technical challenges
Firstly computationaloriented fact checking is not comprehensive enough to cover all the relations
all the relations needed for fake news detection
Secondly it is challenging to validate the correctness of the extracted triples from news articles
our approaches are evaluated with the Kaggles  Getting Real about Fake News dataset
our approaches are evaluated with the Kaggles  Getting some true articles from main stream media
The evaluations show that some of our approaches have over 080 F1scores
