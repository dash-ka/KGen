today a wealth of data are distributed using semantic web standards
today a wealth of knowledge are distributed using semantic web standards
especially in the biomedical domain several sources like more are distributed in the form of owl ontologies
especially in the biomedical domain several sources like snomed nci fma are distributed in the form of owl ontologies
these can be integrated in order to create one large medical knowledge base
these can be matched in order to create one large medical knowledge base
original structure which may affect applications
however an important issue is that the structure of owl ontologies may be profoundly different hence using the mappings as initially computed can lead to incoherences in owl ontologies original structure

in this paper we present a framework approach for integrating independently developed ontologies
in this paper we present a novel approach for integrating independently developed ontologies
an initial seed ontology which may already be in use by an application
starting from an initial seed ontology new sources are used to iteratively extend the seed one
starting from an initial seed ontology new sources are used to iteratively enrich the seed one
a novel finegrained approach which provide an exact
a novel finegrained approach which is based on mapping repair conservativity
a novel finegrained approach which provide approximate algorithms
a novel finegrained approach which formalise structural incompatibilities
a novel finegrained approach which provide practical algorithms
to deal with structural incompatibilities we present a novel finegrained approach
a novel finegrained approach which is based on mapping alignment conservativity
our framework has already been used to integrate a number of medical ontologies provided by babylon health
our framework has already been used to integrate a number of support realworld healthcare services provided by babylon health
stateoftheart ontology integration systems that take into account the structure and coherency of the integrated ontologies obtaining encouraging results
finally our also perform an experimental evaluation
finally our also compare with stateoftheart ontology integration systems
