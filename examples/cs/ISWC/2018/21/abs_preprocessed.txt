this paper aims at approximating the representativeness of a relation within a knowledge base
benfords law which indicates the distribution
the distribution expected by the facts of a relation
for this we use the
the generalized benfords law
we then compute the minimum number of facts
facts that have to be added in order to make the knowledge base representative of the real world
experiments show that our unsupervised method applies to a large number of relations
numerical relations where ground truths exist
for numerical relations the estimated representativeness proves to be a reliable indicator
