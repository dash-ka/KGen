with the popularity of rdf as an independent data model came the need for mechanisms to detect violations of such constraints
with the popularity of rdf as an independent data model came the need for specifying constraints on rdf as an independent data graphs
one of the most promising schema languages for rdf as an independent data is shacl 
one of the most promising schema languages for rdf as an independent data is a recent w3c recommendation
unfortunately the specification of shacl leaves open the problem of validation against recursive constraints
this omission is important because shacl by design favors constraints
other ones which in practice may easily yield reference cycles
constraints that reference other ones
