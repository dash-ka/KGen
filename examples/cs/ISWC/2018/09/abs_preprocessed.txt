We address the concept of research activity
We address the sequence relation between successive activities
We address the automatic extraction from publications of two key concepts for representing research processes
These representations are driven by the Scholarly Ontology specifically conceived for documenting research processes
Unlike relation extraction tasks we are facing textual descriptions of activities of widely variable length while pairs of successive activities often span multiple sentences
Unlike usual named entity recognition we are facing textual descriptions of activities of widely variable length while pairs of successive activities often span multiple sentences
window classifiers using SVMs
we experimented with several
several sliding a twostage pipeline classifier
window classifiers using Logistic Regression
several sliding window classifiers
window classifiers using Random Forests
we developed with several
word embeddings engineered to exploit distinctive traits of research publications
partofspeech embeddings engineered to exploit distinctive traits of research publications
dependency embeddings engineered to exploit distinctive traits of research publications
we classifiers employ taskspecific features
research publications written in English
we classifiers employ dependency embeddings
we classifiers employ word embeddings
we classifiers employ partofspeech embeddings
The extracted activities stored as RDF triples in a knowledge base
sequences are associated with other relevant information from publication metadata
