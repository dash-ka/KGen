increasingly organizations are adopting these ontologies to describe organizations large catalogues of items
these ontologies need to evolve regularly in response to changes in the domain
these ontologies need to evolve regularly in response to the emergence of new requirements
an important step of this process is the selection of candidate concepts to include in the new version of the ontology
this operation needs to take into account a variety of factors
in particular reconcile application performance
in particular reconcile user requirements
current ontology evolution methods focus either on ranking concepts according to current ontology evolution methods relevance
current ontology evolution methods focus either on preserving compatibility with existing applications
however current ontology evolution methods do not take in consideration the impact of the ontology evolution process on the performance of computational tasks similarity computation
however current ontology evolution methods do not take in consideration the impact of the ontology evolution process on the performance of computational tasks generation of recommendations
however current ontology evolution methods do not take in consideration the impact of the ontology evolution process on the performance of computational tasks data clustering
however current ontology evolution methods do not take in consideration the impact of the ontology evolution process on the performance of computational tasks eg in this work we focus on instance tagging
in this paper we propose the pragmatic ontology evolution framework a novel approach for selecting from a group of candidates a set of concepts able to produce a new version of a given ontology effectively supports relevant computational tasks
concepts able to produce a new version of a given ontology that is consistent with the a set of user requirements
in this paper we propose the pragmatic ontology evolution framework a novel approach for selecting from a group of candidates a set of concepts able to produce a new version of a given ontology is parametrised with respect to a number of dimensions
we approach also supports users in navigating the space of possible solutions by showing how certain choices such as privileging trendy concepts would reflect on the application performance
we approach also supports users in navigating the space of possible solutions by showing how certain choices such as privileging historical ones would reflect on the application performance
we approach also supports users in navigating the space of possible solutions by showing how certain choices such as limiting the number of concepts would reflect on the application performance
excellent results demonstrating a significant improvement over alternative approaches
an evaluation of the pragmatic ontology evolution on the realworld scenario of the evolving springer nature taxonomy for editorial classification yielded excellent results
