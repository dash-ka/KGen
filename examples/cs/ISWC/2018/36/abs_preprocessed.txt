Conversational systems have become increasingly popular as a way for humans to interact with computers
To be able to provide intelligent responses conversational systems must correctly model the structure and semantics of a conversation
We introduce the task of measuring semantic  in  coherence in a conversation with respect to background knowledge
concepts introduced during a conversation
background knowledge which relies on the identification of semantic relations between concepts
We evaluate graphbased learningbased approaches for measuring semantic coherence using knowledge graphs vector space embeddings as sources of background knowledge
We propose graphbased learningbased approaches for measuring semantic coherence using word embedding models as sources of background knowledge
We propose machine learningbased approaches for measuring semantic coherence using word embedding models as sources of background knowledge
We evaluate machine learningbased approaches for measuring semantic coherence using word embedding models as sources of background knowledge

We propose graphbased learningbased approaches for measuring semantic coherence using knowledge graphs vector space embeddings as sources of background knowledge
We evaluate graphbased learningbased approaches for measuring semantic coherence using word embedding models as sources of background knowledge
We demonstrate how these approaches are able to uncover different coherence patterns in conversations on the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus
