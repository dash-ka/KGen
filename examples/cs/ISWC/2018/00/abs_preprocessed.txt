Over the recent years embedding methods have attracted increasing focus as a means for knowledge graph completion
Similarly rulebased systems have been studied for this task in the past
What is missing so far is a common evaluation
a common evaluation that includes more than one type of method
We close this gap by comparing representatives of both types of systems in a frequently used evaluation protocol
a finegrained evaluation that gives insight into characteristics of the most popular points out the different strengths and shortcomings of the examined approaches
a finegrained evaluation that gives insight into characteristics of the most popular datasets out the different strengths and shortcomings of the examined approaches
Leveraging the explanatory qualities of rulebased systems we present a finegrained evaluation
Our results show that models such as RESCAL have problems in solving certain types of completion tasks
Our results show that models such as TransE have problems in solving certain types of completion tasks
Our results show that models such as HolE have problems in solving certain types of completion tasks
completion tasks that can be solved by a rulebased approach with high precision
At the same time there are other completion tasks
other completion tasks that are difficult for rulebased systems
Motivated by these insights we combine both families of approaches via ensemble learning
Our results support our assumption that the two methods complement each other in a beneficial way
