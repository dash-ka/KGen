knowledge expressed in rdf knowledge bases to enhance truth discovery performances
this study exploits knowledge
truth discovery aims to identify facts 
facts  when conflicting claims are made by several sources
true claims  when conflicting claims are made by several sources
truth discovery aims to identify true claims 
based on the assumption that true claims are provided by reliable sources truth discovery models iteratively compute source trustworthiness in order to determine which claims are true
based on the assumption that reliable sources provide true claims truth discovery models iteratively compute value confidence in order to determine which claims are true

a model that exploits the knowledge
the knowledge extracted from an existing rdf
we propose a model rdf knowledge base in the form of these rules
the evidence given by the rdf rdf knowledge base to support a claim
these rules are used to quantify the evidence
the evidence is then integrated into the computation of the confidence value to improve the evidence estimation
enhancing truth discovery models efficiently obtains a larger set of reliable facts that vice versa can populate rdf rdf knowledge bases
the proposed approach which led to an improvement of up to 18percent compared to the model we modified
empirical experiments on realworld datasets showed the potential of the proposed approach
