many question answering systems over knowledge graphs rely on entity linking components in order to connect the natural language input to the underlying knowledge graph
many question answering systems over knowledge graphs rely on relation linking components in order to connect the natural language input to the underlying knowledge graph
traditionally entity have been performed either as independent parallel tasks
relation linking

entity linking
a framework called earl
in this paper we propose relation
relation linking as a joint task
in this paper we propose a framework
entity linking
earl which performs entity
the joint entity and relation linking tasks as an instance of the generalised travelling salesman problem
earl implements two different solution strategies the first strategy is a formalisation of the joint entity and relation  gtsp 
two different solution strategies for which we provide a comparative analysis in this paper
in order to be computationally feasible we employ approximate gtsp solvers
the first strategy uses machine learning in order to exploit the connection density between nodes in the knowledge graph
the first strategy relies on reranking steps in order to predict relations
the first strategy relies on three base features in order to predict relations
the first strategy relies on reranking steps in order to predict entities
the first strategy relies on three base features in order to predict entities
we evaluate the strategies on a dataset with 5000 questions
we compare the strategies
the strategies significantly outperform the current stateoftheart approaches for relation linking
the strategies significantly outperform the current stateoftheart approaches for entity linking
