values known to exist but
Blank nodes in RDF graphs can be used to represent values whose identity remains unknown
A prominent example of such usage can be found in the Wikidata dataset where the author of Beowulf is given as a blank node
However while SPARQL considers blank nodes in a query as existentials the author of Beowulf treats blank nodes in RDF data more like constants
counterintuitive results which may make the standard SPARQL semantics unsuitable for datasets with existential blank nodes
Running SPARQL queries over datasets with unknown values may thus lead to counterintuitive results
We thus explore the feasibility of an alternative SPARQL semantics based on certain answers
In order to estimate the performance costs that would be associated with such a change in semantics for current implementations we adapt approximation techniques setting for a core fragment of SPARQL
approximation techniques proposed in a relational database
In order to estimate the performance costs that would be associated with such a change in semantics for current implementations we evaluate approximation techniques setting for a core fragment of SPARQL
To further understand the impact that such a change in semantics may have on query solutions we analyse how this new semantics would affect the results of user queries over Wikidata
