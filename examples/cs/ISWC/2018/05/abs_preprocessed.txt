information extraction that aim to link them with them
information extraction that aim to recognize named entities
Named entity recognition and disambiguation are subtasks of information extraction
named entities mentioned in text
them matching entities in a knowledge base
information extraction that aim to assign them predefined types
Many approaches often exposed as web APIs have been proposed to solve these tasks during the last years
entities using disambiguate web APIs with different knowledge bases
web APIs classify entities
entities using different taxonomies with different knowledge bases
