Converting data from diverse data sources to custom RDF datasets often faces several practical challenges related with the need to restructure
Existing RDF mapping languages assume that the resulting datasets mostly preserve the structure of the source data
In this paper we present real cases by incorporating a programming flavor in the mapping process
real cases that highlight the limitations of existing languages and describe D2RML addresses such practical needs
real cases that highlight the limitations of existing languages and describe a transformationoriented RDF mapping language which addresses such practical needs
