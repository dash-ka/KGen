Formal relations support sophisticated maintenance tasks for sets of templates such as revealing redundancies
Formal relations defined over templates
Formal relations support sophisticated maintenance tasks for sets of templates such as suggesting new templates for representing implicit patterns
Ontology templates are designed for practical use an Open image for terse specification of bulk instances are available including an open source implementation for using templates
Ontology templates are designed for practical use an Open image for terse specification of template definitions are available including an open source implementation for using templates
Ontology templates are designed for practical use an Open image in new window vocabulary convenient serialisation formats for the semantic web are available including an open source implementation for using templates
Our approach is successfully tested on a realworld largescale ontology in the engineering domain
