reasonable ontology templates is a language for representing ontology modelling patterns in the form of parameterised ontologies

with ontology templates modelling patterns can be broken down into convenient pieces
with ontology templates modelling patterns can be used as queries
with ontology templates modelling patterns can be instantiated
with ontology templates modelling patterns can be broken down into manageable pieces
with ontology templates modelling patterns can be encapsulated
with ontology templates modelling patterns can be uniquely identified
formal relations defined over templates
formal relations support sophisticated maintenance tasks for sets of templates such as revealing redundancies
formal relations support sophisticated maintenance tasks for sets of templates such as suggesting new templates for representing implicit patterns
ontology templates are designed for practical use an open image for terse specification of bulk instances are available including an open source implementation for using templates
ontology templates are designed for practical use an open image in new window vocabulary convenient serialisation formats for the semantic web are available including an open source implementation for using templates
ontology templates are designed for practical use an open image for terse specification of template definitions are available including an open source implementation for using templates
our approach is successfully tested on a realworld largescale ontology in the engineering domain
