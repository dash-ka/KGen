we present an unsupervised approach to process natural language questions
process natural language questions that can not be answered by advanced data querying requiring instead adhoc code generation and execution
process natural language questions that can not be answered by factual question answering querying requiring instead adhoc code generation and execution
to address this challenging task our system open image in new window performs languagetocode translation by interpreting the natural language question
a sparql query that is run against codeontology
to address this challenging task our system open image in new window performs languagetocode translation by generating a sparql query
a large rdf repository containing millions of triples
a sparql query that is run against a large rdf repository
triples representing java code constructs
a sparql query that is run against a large rdf repository
triples representing java code constructs
a sparql query that is run against codeontology
the best candidate that is then executed to get the correct answer
a large rdf repository containing millions of triples
a sparql query retrieves a number of java source code snippets and methods ranked by open image in new window on semantic features to find the best candidate
a sparql query retrieves a number of java source code snippets and methods ranked by open image in new window on both syntactic to find the best candidate
experimental results show that our approach is comparable with other stateoftheart proprietary systems such as the closedsource wolframalpha computational knowledge engine
a dataset extracted from stackoverflow
the evaluation of our system is based on a dataset
