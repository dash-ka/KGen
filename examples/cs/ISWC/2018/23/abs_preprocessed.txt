a number of real benchmarks have been proposed for evaluating the performance of link discovery systems
a number of synthetic benchmarks have been proposed for evaluating the performance of link discovery systems
so far only a limited number of link discovery benchmarks target the problem of linking geospatial entities
however some of the largest knowledge bases of the linked open data web such as linkedgeodata contain vast amounts of spatial information
several systems that consider the topology of the spatial resources
several systems that consider the topological relations between the spatial resources
several systems that manage spatial data
several systems have been developed
in order to consider the topological relations between them to perform the much needed data integration in the it is imperative to develop benchmarks for geospatial link discovery
in order to consider the topology of the spatial resources to handle the vast amount of spatial data it is imperative to develop benchmarks for geospatial link discovery

the spatial benchmark generator that can be used to test the performance of link discovery systems
in this paper we propose the spatial benchmark generator
link discovery systems which deal with topological relations as proposed in the state of the art de9im  dimensionally extended nineintersection model 
the spatial benchmark generator implements all topological relations of de9im between linestrings in the twodimensional space
the spatial benchmark generator implements all topological relations of de9im between polygons in the twodimensional space
