While text documents describe entities in freeform Knowledge Bases organizes such information in a structured way
This makes these two information representation forms hard to compare limiting the possibility to use these two information representation forms jointly to improve analytical tasks
This makes these two information representation forms hard to integrate limiting the possibility to use these two information representation forms jointly to improve analytical tasks
