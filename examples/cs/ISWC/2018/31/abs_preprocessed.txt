query processing in such settings is challenging because sparql online analytical processing rrb queries usually contain many triple patterns with grouping
query processing in such settings is challenging because sparql online analytical processing rrb queries usually contain many triple patterns with aggregation

moreover one important factor of query answering on web data is web data provenance
some applications in data analytics require to augment the data with provenance metadata
some applications in access control require to augment the data with provenance metadata
queries that impose constraints on its provenance
some applications in data analytics require to run queries
some applications in access control require to run queries
this task is called provenanceaware query answering
provenance information when answering provenanceaware sparql queries
in this paper we investigate the benefit of caching some parts of an rdf cube augmented with provenance information
a caching approach based on a provenanceaware partitioning of rdf graphs
we propose provenanceaware caching
we propose sparql queries with aggregation
we propose a caching approach
we propose a benefit model for rdf cubes
we results on synthetic data show that provenanceaware caching outperforms significantly the jena tdb native caching in terms of hitrate
we results on real data show that provenanceaware caching outperforms significantly the lru strategy
