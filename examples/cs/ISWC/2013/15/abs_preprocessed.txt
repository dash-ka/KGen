access control required  if any 
When it comes to publishing data on the web the level of access control is highly dependent on the type of content
content exposed
Up until now RDF data publishers have focused on linking public data

With the advent of SPARQL 11 the linked data infrastructure can a means of publishing open data but also as a general mechanism for managing distributed graph data
With the advent of SPARQL 11 the linked data infrastructure can be used
However such a decentralised architecture brings with such a decentralised architecture a number of additional challenges with respect to both data security and integrity
a general authorisation framework that can be used to cater for the secure manipulation of linked data
a general authorisation framework that can be used to deliver dynamic query results based on user credentials
In this paper we propose a general authorisation framework
Specifically we describe how propagation rules can together be used to enforce consistent access control policies
Specifically we describe how graph patterns can together be used to specify consistent access control policies
Specifically we describe how conflict resolution policies can together be used to specify consistent access control policies
