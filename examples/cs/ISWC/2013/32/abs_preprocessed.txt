To bring the Life Sciences domain closer to a Semantic Web realization it is fundamental to establish meaningful relations between biomedical ontologies
diverse biomedical terminology contained in biomedical ontologies
The successful application of ontology matching techniques is strongly tied to an effective exploration of the complex
In this paper we investigate how different approaches for the lexical components of several biomedical ontologies use can impact the performance of ontology matching techniques
In this paper we present an overview of the lexical components of several biomedical ontologies
several biomedical ontologies based both on internal synonym derivation and on external ontologies
synonyms encoded by several biomedical ontologies
We propose novel approaches for exploring the different types of synonyms
We propose novel approaches for extending the lexical components of several biomedical ontologies
