the Protege plugin NoHR that allows the user to query the combined knowledge base
the Protege plugin NoHR that allows the user to take an EL  op ontology
the Protege plugin NoHR that allows the user to add a set of nonmonotonic  rules suitable eg to express defaults
We present the Protege plugin NoHR
the Protege plugin NoHR that allows the user to add a set of nonmonotonic  rules suitable eg to express exceptions
the Protege plugin NoHR that allows the user to add a set of logic programming  rules suitable eg to express exceptions
the Protege plugin NoHR that allows the user to add a set of logic programming  rules suitable eg to express defaults
the rules that can be written
We approach uses the wellfounded semantics for MKNF knowledge bases as underlying formalism so no restriction other than DLsafety is imposed on the rules
The tool The tool builds on the procedure SLG
rules whose result together with the nonmonotonic rules serve as input for the topdown querying engine XSB Prolog
The tool The tool  with the help of OWL 2 EL reasoner ELK preprocesses the ontology into rules
With the resulting plugin even queries to very large ontologies such as SNOMED CT augmented with a large number of rules can be processed at an interactive response time after one initial brief preprocessing period
At the same time We system is able to deal with an ontology
At the same time We system is able to deal with possible inconsistencies between the nonmonotonic rules
an ontology that alone is consistent
