qodi is an automatic ontologybased data integration system
qodi is distinguished in that the ontology mapping algorithm dynamically determines a partial mapping specific to the reformulation of each query
each query provides application context not available in the ontologies alone thereby the system is able to disambiguate mappings for different queries
the ontology mapping algorithm compares the set of paths with a similar decomposition of a source ontology
the ontology mapping algorithm decomposes each query into a set of paths
using test sets from three real world applications qodi achieves favorable results compared with a leading ontology matcher
using test sets from three real world applications qodi achieves favorable results compared with an ontologybased implementation of the mapping methods
using test sets from three real world applications qodi achieves favorable results compared with agreementmaker
