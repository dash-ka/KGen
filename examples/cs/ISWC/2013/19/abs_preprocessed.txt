The basic idea of the combined approach to query answering in the presence of ontologies is to materialize the consequences of the ontology in the data and then use a limited form of query rewriting to deal with infinite materializations
While the combined approach to query answering in the presence of ontologies is efficient for ontologies the combined approach to query answering in the presence of ontologies incurs an exponential blowup during query rewriting
ontologies that are formulated in the basic version of the description logic DLLite
While the combined approach to query answering in the presence of ontologies is scalable for ontologies the combined approach to query answering in the presence of ontologies incurs an exponential blowup during query rewriting
query rewriting when DLLite is extended with the popular role hierarchies
In this paper we show how to replace the query rewriting with a filtering technique
This is natural from an implementation perspective
This allows us to handle role hierarchies without an exponential blowup
an experimental evaluation that demonstrates the scalability of this approach
We also carry out an experimental evaluation
