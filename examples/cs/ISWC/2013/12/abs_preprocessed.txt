Ontology engineering is a task
a task that is notorious for Ontology engineering difficulty
the group that developed Protege
As the group we are keenly aware of how difficult the users perceive this task to be
the group that developed the most widely used ontology editor
In this paper we present the new version of WebProtege that we designed with two main goals in mind create a tool
a tool that will be easy to use while still accounting for commonly used OWL constructs social interaction around distributed ontology editing as part of the core tool design
a tool that will be easy to use while still accounting for commonly used OWL constructs support collaboration around distributed ontology editing as part of the core tool design
we designed this new version of the WebProtege user interface empirically by analysing the use of OWL constructs in a large corpus of publicly available ontologies
Since the beta release of this new WebProtege interface in January 2013 we users from around the world have uploaded 519 ontologies on we server
Since the beta release of this new WebProtege interface in January 2013 we users from around the world have created 519 ontologies on we server
In this paper
we empirical design approach
we describe the key features of the new tool
the OWL constructs that are present in ontologies that users have uploaded to WebProtege
we evaluate language coverage in WebProtege by assessing how well WebProtege covers the OWL constructs
we evaluate the usability of WebProtege through a usability survey
an easytouse webbased tool that covers most of the frequently used OWL constructs
we analysis validates we empirical design suggests additional language constructors to explore
we analysis validates we empirical design demonstrates that an easytouse webbased tool is sufficient for many users to start editing many users ontologies
