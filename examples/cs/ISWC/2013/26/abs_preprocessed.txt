combining structured queries with fulltext search provides a powerful means to access
access distributed linked data
however executing hybrid search queries in a federation of multiple data sources presents a number of challenges due to data source heterogeneity and lack of statistical data about keyword selectivity
a novel hybrid query engine based on the sparql federation framework fedx
to address these challenges we present a novel hybrid query engine
to address these challenges we present fedsearch
we extend the sparql algebra to incorporate keyword search clauses as firstclass citizens
we extend the sparql algebra to apply novel optimization techniques to improve the query processing efficiency while maintaining a meaningful ranking of results
by performing intelligent grouping of query clauses we are able to reduce significantly the communication costs making we approach suitable for topk hybrid search across multiple data sources
by performing onthefly adaptation of the query execution plan we are able to reduce significantly the communication costs making we approach suitable for topk hybrid search across multiple data sources
in experiments we demonstrate that we optimization techniques can lead to a substantial performance improvement reducing the execution time of hybrid queries by more than an order of magnitude
