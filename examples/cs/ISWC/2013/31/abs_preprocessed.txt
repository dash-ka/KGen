Type information is very valuable in knowledge bases
However most large open knowledge bases contain noisy data
However most large open knowledge bases are incomplete with respect to type information
However most large open knowledge bases contain incorrect data
That makes classic type inference by reasoning difficult
In this paper we propose the heuristic linkbased type inference mechanism SDType
the heuristic linkbased type inference mechanism SDType which can handle incorrect data
the heuristic linkbased type inference mechanism SDType which can handle noisy data
Instead of leveraging Tbox information from the schema SDType is also robust to misused schema elements
Instead of leveraging Tbox information from the schema SDType takes the actual use of a schema into account
