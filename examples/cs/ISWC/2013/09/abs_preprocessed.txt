data coming from heterogeneous distributed sources
in the domain of linked open data a need is emerging for developing automated frameworks able to generate the licensing terms
the licensing terms associated to data
this paper proposes a deontic logic semantics
this paper evaluates a deontic logic semantics
a deontic logic semantics which allows us to define the deontic components of obligations
a deontic logic semantics which allows us to generate a composite license compliant with the licensing items of the composed different licenses
a deontic logic semantics which allows us to define the deontic components of the licenses
a deontic logic semantics which allows us to define the deontic components of permissions
a deontic logic semantics which allows us to define the deontic components of prohibitions
some heuristics are proposed to support the data publisher in choosing the licenses composition strategy which better suits her needs wrt the data her is publishing
