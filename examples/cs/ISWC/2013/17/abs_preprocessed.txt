linked stream data extends the linked data paradigm to dynamic data sources
linked stream data enables the joint processing of heterogeneous stream data with quasistatic data from the linked data cloud in nearrealtime
linked stream data enables the integration processing of heterogeneous stream data with quasistatic data from the linked data cloud in nearrealtime
stream update frequencies
several needs to be in improved in terms of dynamic data sizes number of concurrent queries
several linked stream data processing engines exist but several scalability still
several needs to be in improved in terms of static data sizes number of concurrent queries
several linked stream data processing engines
several linked stream data processing engines
so far none of several supports parallel processing in the linked data cloud in nearrealtime
to remedy these limitations this paper presents an approach for elastically parallelizing the continuous execution of queries over linked stream data
for this we have developed novel highly efficient for continuous query operators
for this we have developed scalable parallel algorithms for continuous query operators
algorithms are implemented in we cqels cloud system and we present extensive evaluations of our approach and algorithms superior performance on amazon ec2 demonstrating excellent elasticity in a real deployment
