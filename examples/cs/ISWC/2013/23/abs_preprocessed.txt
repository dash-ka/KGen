we present we work on developing a software platform for mining mathematical scholarly papers to obtain a linked data representation
currently the linking open data cloud lacks detailed information on professional level mathematics
currently the linking open data cloud lacks uptodate information on professional level mathematics
to we mind the main reason for that is the absence of appropriate tools
appropriate tools that could analyze the underlying semantics in mathematical papers and effectively build mathematical papers consolidated representation
ontology based extraction conversion of the article body into rdf integration with some semantic search
ontology based the article body metadata into rdf integration with some existing linking open data data sets search
ontology based extraction conversion of the article body into rdf integration with some existing linking open data data sets search
ontology based the article body metadata into rdf integration with some semantic search
we have developed a holistic approach to analysis of mathematical documents including ontology
we argue that the platform may be helpful for enriching user experience on modern online scientific collections
