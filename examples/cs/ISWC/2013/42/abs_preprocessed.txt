the contextual tag cloud system which can execute large volumes of queries about the number of instances
instances that use particular ontological terms
In this paper we present the infrastructure of the contextual tag cloud system
The contextual tag cloud system is a novel application
tags that defines a subset of instances
instances that use each tag
a novel application that helps users explore a large scale RDF dataset
the font sizes reflect the number of instances
the tags are properties 
the tags are ontological terms 
the context is a set of tags
the tags are classes 
instances specified by the context a user constructs
The contextual tag cloud system visualizes the patterns of instances
Given a request with a specific context The contextual tag cloud system needs to quickly find what how many instances in the context use each tag
Given a request with a specific context The contextual tag cloud system needs to quickly find what other tags the instances in the context use instances in the context use each tag
The key question we answer in this paper is how to scale to Linked Data in particular we use a dataset with 14 billion triples
The key question we answer in this paper is how to scale to Linked Data in particular we use a dataset over 380000 tags
This is complicated by the fact that the calculation should when directed by the user consider the entailment of taxonomic andor domainrange axioms in the ontology
we use three approaches to prune unnecessary counts for faster intersection computations
we combine a scalable preprocessing approach with a speciallyconstructed inverted index
we compare we system with a stateoftheart triple store examine how pruning rules interact with inference
we compare we system with a stateoftheart triple store analyze we design choices
