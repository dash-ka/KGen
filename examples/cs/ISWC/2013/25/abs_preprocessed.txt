the lightweight description logic EL which forms a basis of some large ontologies like NCI
the lightweight description logic EL which forms a basis of some large ontologies like Gene Ontology
TBoxes expressed in the lightweight description logic EL
the lightweight description logic EL which forms a basis of some large ontologies like SNOMED
We discuss the problem of minimizing TBoxes
the lightweight description logic EL which forms a basis of some large ontologies like Galen
We show that the minimization of TBoxes is intractable  NPcomplete 
While this looks like a bad news result We also provide a heuristic technique for minimizing TBoxes
We prove the correctness of the heuristics
ontologies which we define through an acyclicity constraint over a reference relation between equivalence classes of concepts
We show that the heuristics provides optimal results for a class of ontologies
To establish the feasibility of our approach our evaluated the algorithm effectiveness on a small suite of benchmarks
To establish the feasibility of our approach our have implemented the algorithm
