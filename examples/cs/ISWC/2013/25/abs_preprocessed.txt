the lightweight description logic el which forms a basis of some large ontologies like snomed
the lightweight description logic el which forms a basis of some large ontologies like gene ontology
we discuss the problem of minimizing tboxes
tboxes expressed in the lightweight description logic el
the lightweight description logic el which forms a basis of some large ontologies like nci
the lightweight description logic el which forms a basis of some large ontologies like galen
we show that the minimization of tboxes is intractable  npcomplete 
while this looks like a bad news result we also provide a heuristic technique for minimizing tboxes
we show that the heuristics provides optimal results for a class of ontologies
we prove the correctness of the heuristics
ontologies which we define through an acyclicity constraint over a reference relation between equivalence classes of concepts
to establish the feasibility of our approach our evaluated the algorithm effectiveness on a small suite of benchmarks
to establish the feasibility of our approach our have implemented the algorithm
