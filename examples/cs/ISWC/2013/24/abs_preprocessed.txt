the discovery of links between resources within knowledge bases is of crucial importance to realize the vision of the semantic web
addressing this task is especially challenging when dealing with geospatial datasets due to the potential complexity of single geospatial objects
addressing this task is especially challenging when dealing with geospatial datasets due to this task sheer size of single geospatial objects
yet so far little attention has been paid to the characteristics of geospatial data within the context of link discovery
in this paper we address this gap by presenting a reductionratiooptimal link discovery approach
a reductionratiooptimal link discovery approach designed especially for geospatial data
in this paper we address this gap by presenting orchid
orchid relies on a combination of the hausdorff to compute the distance between geospatial objects
orchid relies on a combination of orthodromic metrics to compute the distance between geospatial objects
we first present two novel approaches for the efficient computation of hausdorff distances
then we present the space tiling approach implemented by orchid
then we present the space tiling approach prove that it is optimal with respect to the reduction ratio that orchid can achieve
the evaluation of we approaches is carried out on three real datasets of different size and complexity
we results suggest that we approaches to the computation of hausdorff distances require two orders of magnitude less orthodromic distances computations to compare geographical data
moreover our approaches to the computation of hausdorff distances require two orders of magnitude less time than a naive approach to achieve this goal
finally our results indicate that orchid scales to large datasets while outperforming the state of the art significantly
