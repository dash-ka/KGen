for ontology reuse and integration a number of approaches have been devised that aim at identifying small sets of  relevant  axioms from ontologies

here we consider three logically sound notions of modules mex modules only applicable to inexpressive ontologies these modules a sound approximation of the first polynomial in the size of the ontology
modules based on syntactic locality a sound approximation of and thus the first  widely used since these modules can be extracted from owl dl ontologies in time
