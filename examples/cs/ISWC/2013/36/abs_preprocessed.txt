experimentation is an important way to validate results of computer science research in general
in this paper we investigate the development
in this paper we investigate the current status of experimental work on the semantic web
500 papers collected from the international semantic web conferences over the past decade
based on a corpus of 500 papers we analyse the quality of experimental research compare the importance to general computer science
based on a corpus of 500 papers we analyse the quality of experimental research conducted
based on a corpus of 500 papers we analyse the importance
we observe that the amount and quality of experiments are steadily increasing over time
the amount of experimental work reported
we can not confirm a statistically significant correlation between a papers citations
unlike hypothesised
our analysis however shows that papers are more often cited than other papers
papers comparing our analysis to other systems
