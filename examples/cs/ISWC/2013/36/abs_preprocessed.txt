Experimentation is an important way to validate results of Computer Science research in general
In this paper we investigate the development
In this paper we investigate the current status of experimental work on the Semantic Web
Based on a corpus of 500 papers we analyse the importance
Based on a corpus of 500 papers we analyse the quality of experimental research compare the importance to general Computer Science
500 papers collected from the International Semantic Web Conferences over the past decade
Based on a corpus of 500 papers we analyse the quality of experimental research conducted
We observe that the amount and quality of experiments are steadily increasing over time
Unlike hypothesised
we can not confirm a statistically significant correlation between a papers citations
the amount of experimental work reported
Our analysis however shows that papers are more often cited than other papers
papers comparing Our analysis to other systems
