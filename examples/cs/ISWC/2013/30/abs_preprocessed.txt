a largescale knowledge base that exploits wikipedia as primary data source
dbpedia is a largescale knowledge base
the extraction procedure requires to manually map wikipedia infoboxes into the dbpedia ontology
thanks to a large number of infoboxes has been mapped in the english dbpedia
thanks to crowdsourcing has been mapped in the english dbpedia
consequently the same procedure has been applied to other languages to create the localized versions of dbpedia
however the number of accomplished mappings is still small to most frequent infoboxes
however the number of accomplished mappings is still limited to most frequent infoboxes
furthermore mappings need maintenance due to the constant changes of wikipedia articles
furthermore mappings need maintenance due to the quick changes of wikipedia articles
in this paper we focus on the problem of automatically mapping infobox attributes to properties into the dbpedia ontology for extending the coverage of building from scratch versions for languages not covered in the current version
in this paper we focus on the problem of automatically mapping infobox attributes to properties into the dbpedia ontology for extending the coverage of the existing localized versions
the evaluation has been performed on the italian mappings
we compared we results with the current mappings on a random sample reannotated by the authors
we report results comparable to the ones
we approach leads to a significant improvement in recall
we approach leads to a significant improvement in speed
the ones obtained by a human annotator in term of precision
specifically we mapped 45978 wikipedia infobox attributes to dbpedia properties in 14 different languages
14 different languages for which mappings were not yet available
