nowadays search on the web increasingly takes advantage of the growing amount of structured data
nowadays search on the web goes beyond the retrieval of textual web sites
entity search where the units of retrieval are structured these entities
of particular interest is entity search
these entities are therefore called  uncooperative 
different sources which may provide only limited information about these entities content
these entities reside in different sources
further different sources which may provide only limited information about their content capture complementary but also redundant information about entities
in this environment of uncooperative data sources we study the problem of federated entity search
entity consolidation performed at query time
federated entity search where redundant information about entities is reduced onthefly through entity consolidation
entity consolidation that is based on using language models hence more suitable for this onthefly uncooperative setting than stateoftheart methods
entity consolidation that is completely unsupervised hence more suitable for this onthefly uncooperative setting than stateoftheart methods
we propose a novel method for entity consolidation
stateoftheart methods that require training data
further we apply the same language model technique to deal with the federated search problem of ranking results returned from different sources
particular novel are the mechanisms we propose to incorporate consolidation results into this ranking
experiments using real web queries
experiments using data sources
we perform experiments
we experiments show that we approach for federated entity search with onthefly consolidation improves upon the performance of a stateoftheart preference aggregation baseline and also benefits from consolidation
