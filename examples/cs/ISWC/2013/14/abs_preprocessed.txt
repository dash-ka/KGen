We describe a method for updating the classification of ontologies
ontologies expressed in the EL family of Description Logics after some axioms have been added
ontologies expressed in the EL family of Description Logics after some axioms have been deleted
logical consequences that are no longer valid
While incremental classification modulo additions is relatively straightforward handling deletions is more problematic since incremental classification modulo additions requires retracting logical consequences
Known algorithms address this problem
this problem using various forms of bookkeeping to trace the consequences back to premises
But such additional data place an extra burden on the reasoner during application of inferences
But such additional data can consume memory
a technique which avoids this extra cost while being very efficient for small incremental changes in ontologies
In this paper we present a technique
