the topic learning towards structure information
For analyzing this type of data existing topic modeling approaches require manuallydefined regularization terms to to bias the topic
existing topic modeling approaches which are highly tailored toward document collections
For analyzing this type of data existing topic modeling approaches require manuallydefined regularization terms to exploit
an approach called Topical Relational Model
We propose an approach as a principled approach for automatically learning topics from both textual information
We propose an approach as a principled approach for automatically learning topics from both structure information
a stateoftheart approach that requires manuallytuned regularization
Using a topic model we can show that We approach is effective in exploiting heterogeneous structure information outperforming a stateoftheart approach
