Webscale relation extraction is a means for building
extending large repositories of formalized knowledge
precision which is hard to achieve with automatically acquired rule sets
This type of automated knowledge building requires a decent level of precision learned from unlabeled data by means of minimal supervision
This type of automated knowledge building requires a decent level of precision learned from unlabeled data by means of distant supervision
This paper shows how precision of relation extraction can be considerably improved by employing BabelNet for effective semantic rule
This paper shows how precision of relation extraction can be considerably improved by employing generalpurpose lexical semantic network for effective semantic rule
This paper shows how precision of relation extraction can be considerably improved by employing a widecoverage for effective semantic rule
effective semantic rule filtering
We apply Word Sense Disambiguation to the content words of the automatically extracted rules
each of relationspecific relevant concepts is then used to represent the structured semantics of the corresponding relation
As a result a set of relationspecific relevant concepts is obtained
The resulting relationspecific subgraphs of BabelNet are used as semantic filters for estimating the adequacy of the extracted rules
the seven semantic relations tested here
For the seven semantic relations the semantic filter consistently yields a higher precision at any relative recall value in the highrecall range
