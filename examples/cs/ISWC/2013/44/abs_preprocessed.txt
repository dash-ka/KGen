In our previous work our showed how a scalable OWL 2 RL reasoner can be used to compute both lower bound query answers over arbitrary OWL 2 ontologies
In our previous work our showed how a scalable OWL 2 RL reasoner can be used to compute both upper bound query answers over arbitrary OWL 2 ontologies
However when these bounds do not coincide there still remain a number of possible answer tuples
possible answer tuples whose status is not determined
the data and ontology that is large enough to resolve the status of these tuples yet small enough so that the status of these tuples can be computed using a fullyfledged OWL 2 reasoner
In this paper our show computed by a scalable OWL 2 RL reasoner to efficiently identify a subset of the data and ontology
our show how in the case of Horn ontologies one can exploit the lower
our show how in the case of Horn ontologies one can exploit upper bounds
The resulting hybrid approach has enabled us to compute exact answers to queries over datasets where previously only approximate query answering was possible
