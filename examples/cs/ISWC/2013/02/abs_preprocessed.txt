although an increasing number of rdf knowledge bases are published many of those lack sophisticated schemata
although an increasing number of rdf knowledge bases are published many of those consist primarily of instance data
having such schemata allows consistency checking
having such schemata allows debugging as well as improved inference
having such schemata allows more powerful querying
the reasons why schemata are still rare
one of the reasons is the effort
the effort required to create one of the reasons why schemata are still rare
a semiautomatic schemata construction approach addressing this problem the frequency of axiom patterns in existing knowledge bases
a semiautomatic schemata construction approach addressing this problem first in existing knowledge bases
in this article we propose a semiautomatic schemata construction approach is discovered
afterwards those patterns are converted to sparql based pattern detection algorithms
pattern detection algorithms which allow to enrich knowledge base schemata
we argue that we present the first scalable knowledge base enrichment approach based on real schema usage patterns
the first scalable knowledge base enrichment approach is evaluated on a large set of knowledge bases with a quantitative
