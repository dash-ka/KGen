Much of Web search is today centered around entities
Much of browsing activity is today centered around entities
For this reason Search Engine Result Pages increasingly contain information about the searched entities such as short summaries
For this reason Search Engine Result Pages increasingly contain information about the searched entities such as related entities
For this reason Search Engine Result Pages increasingly contain information about the searched entities such as pictures
For this reason Search Engine Result Pages increasingly contain information about the searched entities such as factual information
A key facet that is often displayed on the Engine Result Pages and that
A key facet is instrumental for many applications is the entity type
more specific types which may be relevant
However an entity is usually not associated to a set of more specific types or not given the document context
However an entity is usually not associated to a single generic type in the background knowledge bases or not given the document context
For example one can find on the Linked Open Data cloud the fact that Tom Hanks is a person
For example one can find on the Linked Open Data cloud the fact that Tom Hanks is an actor
For example one can find on the Linked Open Data cloud the fact that Tom Hanks is a person from Concord California
some may be too general to be eg person  while other may be irrelevant given the current browsing context 
some may be too general to be interesting  while other may be already known to eg actor 
some may be too general to be eg person  while other may be interesting
some may be too general to be eg person  while other may be already known to the user 
some may be too general to be interesting  while other may be already known to the user 
some may be too general to be eg person  while other may be irrelevant given eg person from Concord California Concord California 
All those types are correct
some may be too general to be interesting  while other may be irrelevant given eg person from Concord California Concord California 
some may be too general to be interesting  while other may be interesting
some may be too general to be eg person  while other may be already known to eg actor
