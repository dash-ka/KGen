ontologies that contain her terms of interest
when a user searches a collection of ontologies for her terms of interest there are often dozens of ontologies
how does her know which ontology is the most relevant to her search
our research group hosts bioportal 
our research group hosts a public repository of more than 330 ontologies in the biomedical domain
when a term that a user searches for is available in multiple ontologies how do our rank the results
how do our measure how well our ranking works
in this paper our develop an evaluation framework
an evaluation framework that enables developers to analyze the performance of different ontologyranking methods
an evaluation framework that enables developers to compare the performance of different ontologyranking methods
our framework is based on processing search logs
our framework is determining how often users select the top link that the search engine offers
our evaluate our framework by analyzing the data on bioportal searches
our explore several different ranking algorithms
our measure the effectiveness of each ranking by measuring how often users click on the highest ranked ontology
our collected log data from more than 4800 bioportal searches
our results show that regardless of the ranking in more than half the searches users select the first link
thus it is even more critical to ensure that the ranking is appropriate if our want to have satisfied users
our further analysis demonstrates that ranking ontologies based on page view data significantly improves the user experience with an approximately 26
