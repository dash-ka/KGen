we study confidentiality enforcement in ontologybased information systems where ontologies are expressed in owl 2 rl
owl 2 that is becoming increasingly popular in semantic web applications
we formalise a natural adaptation of the controlled query evaluation  cqe  framework to ontologies
cqe algorithms that ensure confidentiality of sensitive information are efficiently implementable by means of rdf triple store technologies
we goal is to provide cqe algorithms
we goal is to ensure all three requirements
we formally can not be satisfied without imposing restrictions on ontologies
we formally show that all three requirements are in conflict
we propose the identified fragment
for the identified fragment we design a cqe algorithm
a cqe algorithm that has the same computational complexity as standard query answering
a cqe algorithm that can be implemented by relying on stateoftheart triple stores
