we illustrate several novel attacks to the confidentiality of knowledge bases
then we introduce a new confidentiality model sensitive enough to detect several novel attacks and a method for constructing secure knowledge bases views
the background knowledge exploited in the attacks
we identify safe approximations of the background knowledge safe approximations of the background knowledge can be used to reduce the complexity of constructing secure knowledge bases views
