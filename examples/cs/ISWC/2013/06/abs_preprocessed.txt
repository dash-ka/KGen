The normative version of RDF Schema gives nonstandard  intensional  interpretations to some standard notions such as properties thus departing from standard setbased semantics
The normative version of RDF Schema gives nonstandard  intensional  interpretations to some standard notions such as classes thus departing from standard setbased semantics
In this paper we develop a standard setbased  extensional  semantics for the RDF Schema vocabulary while preserving the computational complexity of deduction of the intensional version

This result can positively impact current implementations as reasoning in RDF Schema can be compatible with OWL extensions
This result can positively impact current implementations as reasoning in RDF Schema can be implemented following common setbased intuitions
