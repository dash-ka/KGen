A common problem is the imprecision in the use of vocabularies annotators can misunderstand the semantics of a class or property
A common problem is the imprecision in the use of vocabularies annotators may not be able to find the right objects to annotate with
This paper decreases the quality of data
This paper may eventually hamper This paper usability over large scale
This paper describes Statistical Knowledge Patterns  as a means to address this issue
This paper describes SKP  as a means to address this issue
SKPs encapsulate key information about ontology classes including synonymous properties in datasets
SKPs are automatically generated based on statistical data analysis
SKPs can be effectively used to increase recall in querying
SKPs can be effectively used to automatically normalise data
Both pattern extraction are completely automated
Both pattern usage are completely automated
The main benefits of SKPs are that The main benefits of SKPs structure allows for both accurate query expansion and restriction The main benefits of SKPs are context dependent The main benefits of SKPs can be generated offline hence the equivalence among relations can be used efficiently at run time
The main benefits of SKPs are that The main benefits of SKPs structure allows for both accurate query expansion and restriction The main benefits of SKPs are context dependent hence The main benefits of SKPs describe the usage and meaning of properties in the context of a particular class hence the equivalence among relations can be used efficiently at run time
