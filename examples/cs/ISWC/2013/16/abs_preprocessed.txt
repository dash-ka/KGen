the semantic web makes an extensive use of the owl dl ontology language underlied by the shoiq description logic to formalize the semantic web resources
this logic extended with the transitive closure of roles in concept axioms
in this paper we propose a decision procedure for this logic
a feature needed in several application domains
this logic extended with the transitive closure of roles in a feature
the most challenging issue we have to deal with when designing such a decision procedure is to represent infinitely nontreeshaped models
infinitely nontreeshaped models which are different from those of shoiq ontologies
models which may have an infinite nontreeshaped part
a new blocking condition for characterizing models
to address the most challenging issue we have to deal with when designing such a decision procedure we introduce a new
