Over the last years the Web of Data has developed into a large compendium of interlinked data sets from multiple domains
Due to the decentralised architecture of this compendium several of the Web of Data contain duplicated data
Yet so far only little attention has been paid to the effect of duplicated data on federated querying
This work presents a novel duplicateaware approach to federated querying over the Web of Data
This work presents DAW 
DAW is based on a combination of compact data summaries
DAW is based on a combination of minwise independent permutations
a novel duplicateaware approach to federated querying over the Web of Data is based on a combination of minwise independent permutations
a novel duplicateaware approach to federated querying over the Web of Data is based on a combination of compact data summaries
It can be directly combined with existing federated query engines in order to achieve the same query recall values while querying fewer data sources
We extend three wellknown federated query processing engines FedX with DAW
We extend three wellknown federated query processing engines DARQ with DAW
We extend three wellknown federated query processing engines SPLENDID with DAW
We compare We extensions with the original approaches
queries sent to the endpoints
The comparison shows that DAW can greatly reduce the number of queries while keeping high query recall values
The comparison shows that a novel duplicateaware approach to federated querying over the Web of Data can greatly reduce the number of queries while keeping high query recall values
Therefore It can significantly improve the performance of federated query processing engines
the query recall when the query processing is limited to a subset of the sources
Moreover a novel duplicateaware approach to federated querying over the Web of Data provides a source selection mechanism
Moreover DAW provides a source selection mechanism
a source selection mechanism that maximises the query recall
