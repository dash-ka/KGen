empirical activities often resort to  somewhat arbitrarily  hand curated corpora such as the ncbo bioportal
empirical activities often resort to  somewhat arbitrarily  hand curated corpora such as the tones repository
empirical activities often resort to  somewhat arbitrarily  hand curated corpora manually selected sets of wellknown ontologies
empirical activities often resort to  somewhat arbitrarily  hand curated corpora available on the web
findings of results of benchmarking activities may be biased even heavily towards these datasets
findings of surveys of benchmarking activities may be biased even heavily towards these datasets
sampling from a large corpus of ontologies on the other hand may lead to more representative results
