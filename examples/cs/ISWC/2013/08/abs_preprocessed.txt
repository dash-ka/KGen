The vision behind the Web of Data is to extend the current documentoriented Web with structured data thus creating a representation of general knowledge
The vision behind the Web of Data is to extend the current documentoriented Web with machinereadable facts thus creating a representation of general knowledge
However most of the Web of Data is limited to being a large compendium of encyclopedic knowledge
encyclopedic knowledge describing entities
A huge challenge the massive extraction of RDF facts from unstructured data has remained open so far
A huge challenge the timely extraction of RDF facts from unstructured data has remained open so far
The availability of such knowledge on the Web of Data would provide significant benefits to manifold applications

an approach that allows extracting RDF triples from unstructured data streams
In this paper we address the problem of the actuality of the Web of Data by presenting an approach
We employ statistical methods in disambiguation to create a knowledge base
a knowledge base that reflects the content of the input streams
We employ statistical methods in combination with deduplication to create a knowledge base
We employ statistical methods in unsupervised machine learning techniques to create a knowledge base
We employ statistical methods in supervised machine learning techniques to create a knowledge base
We evaluate a sample of the RDF We generate against a large corpus of news streams
We evaluate a sample of the RDF We show that We achieve a precision of more than 85
