encyclopedic knowledge describing entities
however most of the web of data is limited to being a large compendium of encyclopedic knowledge
a huge challenge the massive extraction of rdf facts from unstructured data has remained open so far

an approach that allows extracting rdf triples from unstructured data streams
in this paper we address the problem of the actuality of the web of data by presenting an approach
we employ statistical methods in supervised machine learning techniques to create a knowledge base
we employ statistical methods in disambiguation to create a knowledge base
a knowledge base that reflects the content of the input streams
we employ statistical methods in unsupervised machine learning techniques to create a knowledge base
we employ statistical methods in combination with deduplication to create a knowledge base
we evaluate a sample of the rdf we generate against a large corpus of news streams
we evaluate a sample of the rdf we show that we achieve a precision of more than 85
