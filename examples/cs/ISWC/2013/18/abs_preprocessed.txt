automation of service composition is one of the most interesting challenges
the most interesting challenges facing the semantic web today
the most interesting challenges facing the web of services today
despite approaches services data flow remains implicit and difficult to be automatically generated
approaches which are able to infer a partial order of services
enhanced with formal representations the semantic links between input parameters of services can be then exploited to infer services data flow
enhanced with formal representations the semantic links between output parameters of services can be then exploited to infer services data flow
this work addresses the problem of effectively inferring data flow between services
services based on this work representations
to this end we introduce the non standard description logic reasoning join aiming to provide a  constructive evidence  of why services can be connected and how non trivial links  can be inferred in data flow
to this end we introduce the non standard description logic reasoning join aiming to provide a  constructive evidence  of why services can be connected and how many to many parameters  can be inferred in data flow
the preliminary evaluation provides evidence in favor of we approach regarding the completeness of data flow
