standard ontologies queries and data stored in relational databases
we demonstrate that for standard ontologies queries and data ontop is fast efficient
we demonstrate that for standard ontologies queries and data ontop is fast produces sql rewritings of high quality
we analyse the performance of ontop in a series of experiments
