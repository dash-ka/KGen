We discuss the theoretical foundations of Ontop the treewitness query rewriting Tmappings based on database integrity constraints
We discuss the theoretical foundations of Ontop the treewitness query rewriting optimisations based on SQL features

We discuss the theoretical foundations of Ontop the treewitness query rewriting Tmappings based on SQL features
We analyse the performance of Ontop in a series of experiments
We demonstrate that for standard ontologies queries and data Ontop is fast produces SQL rewritings of high quality
