research effort in ontology visualization has largely focused on developing new visualization techniques
at the same time researchers have paid less attention to investigating the usability of common visualization techniques that many practitioners regularly use to visualize ontological data
in this paper we focus on two popular ontology visualization techniques graph
in this paper we focus on two popular ontology visualization techniques indented tree
we conduct a controlled usability study with an emphasis on the effectiveness efficiency workload and satisfaction of two popular ontology visualization techniques indented tree and graph in the context of assisting users during evaluation of ontology mappings
findings from a controlled usability study with an emphasis on the effectiveness efficiency workload and satisfaction of these visualization techniques have revealed both strengths and weaknesses of each visualization technique
in particular while the indented tree visualization is more organized and familiar to novice users subjects found the graph visualization to be more controllable and intuitive without visual redundancy particularly for ontologies with multiple inheritance
