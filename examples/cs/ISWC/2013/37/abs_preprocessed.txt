a source model that includes the relationships between the attributes in addition to the attributes in addition semantic types
however constructing a source model remains a largely unsolved problem
known sources that have been modeled over the same domain ontology
in this paper we present a graphbased approach to hypothesize a rich semantic description of a new target source from a set of known sources
a graph that represents the space of plausible source descriptions
we exploit the known source models to build a graph
we exploit the same domain ontology to build a graph
then we compute the top k candidates and suggest to the user a ranked list of the semantic models for the new source
known sources that have been modeled over the same domain ontology
a graphbased approach to hypothesize a rich semantic description of a new target source from a set of known sources takes into account user corrections to learn more accurate semantic descriptions of future data sources
the art system that does not learn from prior models
our evaluation shows that our method produces models
models that are twice as accurate than the models
the models produced using a state of the art system
