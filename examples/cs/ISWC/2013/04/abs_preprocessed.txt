the web covering disparate
with thousands of rdf data sources available on the web and possibly overlapping knowledge domains the problem of providing highlevel descriptions  in the form of metadata  of thousands of rdf data content becomes crucial
in this paper we introduce a theoretical framework for describing data sources in terms of data sources completeness
completeness statements expressed in rdf
we show how existing data sources can be described with completeness statements
we then focus on the problem of the completeness of query answering over plain data sources augmented with completeness statements
we then focus on the problem of the completeness of query answering over rdfs data sources augmented with completeness statements
finally we present an extension of the completeness framework for federated data sources
