the appropriate data which is then possibly combined again with other data by means of a query language
the appropriate data which is then enriched with analytics
however many realworld tasks conceptually involve combinations of these approaches a graph query can be used to select the appropriate data
the appropriate data which is then possibly filtered again with other data by means of a query language
a language that is wellsuited for both graph querying
a language that is wellsuited for analytical tasks
in this paper we propose a language
we propose a minimalistic extension of sparql to allow for expressing analytical tasks over existing sparql infrastructure in particular we propose to extend sparql with recursive features
we propose a minimalistic extension of sparql to allow for expressing analytical tasks over existing sparql infrastructure in particular we propose to provide a formal syntax and semantics for our language
we show that our language can express key analytical tasks on graphs  in fact our language is turing complete 
moreover queries in this language can also be compiled into sequences of iterations of sparql update statements
we show how procedures in we can be implemented over offtheshelf sparql engines with a specialised client
a specialised client that can leverage database operations to improve the performance of queries
results for we implementation show that procedures for popular analytics currently run in seconds for selective subgraphs  our target usecase
