knowledge graphs constitute powerful formalisms to integrate a myriad of existing data sources
Data has exponentially grown in the last years
Transformation functions specified with functionbased mapping languages like RMLFnO can be applied to overcome interoperability issues across heterogeneous data sources
Transformation functions specified with functionbased mapping languages like FunUL can be applied to overcome interoperability issues across heterogeneous data sources
these mapping languages global adoption
However the absence of engines to efficiently execute these mapping languages hinders these
We propose FunMap  an interpreter of functionbased mapping languages relies on a set of lossless rewriting rules to materialize the execution of functions in initial steps of knowledge graph creation

any functionbased mapping language that supports
Although applicable to any functionbased mapping language joins between mapping rules FunMap feasibility is shown on RMLFnO
FunMap reduces data redundancy and unused attributes and converts RMLFnO mappings into a set of equivalent rules executable on RMLcompliant engines
FunMap reduces data redundancy and duplicates and converts RMLFnO mappings into a set of equivalent rules executable on RMLcompliant engines
We evaluate FunMap performance over realworld testbeds from the biomedical domain
The results indicate that FunMap reduces the execution time of RMLcompliant engines by up to a factor of 18 furnishing thus a scalable solution for knowledge graph creation
