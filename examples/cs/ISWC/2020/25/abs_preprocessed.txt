language models are both active research areas in machine learning and semantic web
knowledge graphs are both active research areas in machine learning and semantic web
while language models have brought great improvements for many downstream tasks on language models own language models are often combined with knowledge graphs
knowledge graphs providing additionally aggregated well structured knowledge
usually this is done by leveraging knowledge graphs to improve language models
but what happens if we use language models to improve knowledge graphs
but what happens if we turn this around
