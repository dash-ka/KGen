automatically detecting ie meaning changes  of single words has recently received strong research attention
automatically detecting semantic shifts  of single words has recently received strong research attention
various measures which are intended to capture the somewhat elusive and undifferentiated concept of semantic shift
these computational approaches have introduced various measures
on the other hand there is a well established distinction in linguistics between a words paradigmatic 
on the other hand there is a longstanding distinction in syntagmatic associations 
on the other hand there is a longstanding distinction in linguistics between ie terms 
terms that typically occur next to a word
on the other hand there is a longstanding distinction in ie terms 
on the other hand there is a well established distinction in linguistics between ie terms 
terms that can replace a word
on the other hand there is a well established distinction in ie terms 
on the other hand there is a longstanding distinction in linguistics between a words paradigmatic 
on the other hand there is a well established distinction in syntagmatic associations 
a method that captures a measures sensitivity for paradigmatic andor syntagmatic  association  shifts
in this work we join these two lines of research by introducing a method
for this purpose we perform synthetic distortions on textual corpora
textual corpora that in turn induce shifts in word embeddings
word embeddings trained on them
we find that the local neighborhood is sensitive to paradigmatic
the global semantic displacement is sensitive to syntagmatic shift in word embeddings
words that undergo syntagmatic shift both separately

by applying the newly we find examples of words
words that undergo paradigmatic shift both separately
with this more nuanced understanding of semantic shift on word embeddings we hope to analyze a similar concept of semantic shift on rdf graph embeddings in the future
