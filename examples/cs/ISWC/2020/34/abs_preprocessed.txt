Automatically detecting semantic shifts  of single words has recently received strong research attention
Automatically detecting ie meaning changes  of single words has recently received strong research attention
to quantify the impact of realworld events on online communities
These computational approaches have introduced various measures
various measures which are intended to capture the somewhat elusive and undifferentiated concept of semantic shift
On the other hand there is a longstanding distinction in syntagmatic associations 
On the other hand there is a well established distinction in linguistics between a words paradigmatic 
On the other hand there is a longstanding distinction in ie terms 
On the other hand there is a well established distinction in linguistics between ie terms 
terms that typically occur next to a word
On the other hand there is a well established distinction in syntagmatic associations 
On the other hand there is a well established distinction in ie terms 
On the other hand there is a longstanding distinction in linguistics between ie terms 
On the other hand there is a longstanding distinction in linguistics between a words paradigmatic 
terms that can replace a word
a method that captures a measures sensitivity for paradigmatic andor syntagmatic  association  shifts
In this work we join these two lines of research by introducing a method
For this purpose we perform synthetic distortions on textual corpora
textual corpora that in turn induce shifts in word embeddings
word embeddings trained on them
We find that the Local Neighborhood is sensitive to paradigmatic
the Global Semantic Displacement is sensitive to syntagmatic shift in word embeddings
the newly validated paradigmatic measures on three realworld datasets 
the newly validated syntagmatic measures on Amazon Wikipedia 
the newly validated syntagmatic measures on Amazon Reddit 
words that undergo syntagmatic shift both at the same time
the newly validated paradigmatic measures on Amazon Reddit 
words that undergo paradigmatic shift both separately
the newly validated paradigmatic measures on Amazon Wikipedia 
the newly validated syntagmatic measures on three realworld datasets 
words that undergo syntagmatic shift both separately
By applying the newly we find examples of words
words that undergo paradigmatic shift both at the same time
With this more nuanced understanding of semantic shift on word embeddings we hope to analyze a similar concept of semantic shift on RDF graph embeddings in the future
