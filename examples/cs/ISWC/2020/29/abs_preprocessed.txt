the hyponymhypernym relation is an essential element in the hypernym cooccurrence network
identifying the hypernym from a definition is an important task in natural language processing
identifying the hypernym from a definition is an important task in semantic analysis
while a public dictionary such as wordnet works for common words a public dictionary such as wordnet application in domainspecific scenarios is limited
existing tools for hypernym extraction either rely on specific semantic patterns
the word representation which all demonstrate certain limitations
existing tools for hypernym extraction either focus on the word representation
here we propose a method by combining both the syntactic structure in definitions given by the words part of speech
here we propose a method by combining both the syntactic structure in definitions given by the bidirectional gated recurrent unit network as the learning kernel
the output can be further tuned by including other features such as a words centrality in the hypernym cooccurrence network
wikipedia featuring definition with high regularity
the method is tested in the corpus from wikipedia
stackoverflow whose definition is usually irregular
the method is tested in the corpus from the corpus from stackoverflow
the method shows enhanced performance compared with other tools in both corpora
