It is sometimes claimed that adding inferred axioms eg the inferred class hierarchy to an ontology can improve an ontologys usability in practice
It is sometimes claimed that adding inferred axioms eg the inferred class hierarchy to an ontology can improve reasoning performance
While such beliefs may have an effect on how ontologies are published there is no conclusive empirical evidence to support such beliefs
To develop an understanding of the impact of this practice both for tools we survey to what extent published ontologies in BioPortal already contain such beliefs most specific class assertions
To develop an understanding of the impact of this practice both for ontology curators we survey to what extent published ontologies in BioPortal already contain such beliefs most specific class assertions

added inferred axioms from these sets
Furthermore we investigate how added can affect the performance of standard reasoning tasks such as realisation
Furthermore we investigate how added can affect the performance of standard reasoning tasks such as classification
We find that most specific class assertions are highly prevalent in published biomedical ontologies
We find that axioms from the the inferred class hierarchy
We reasoning evaluation indicates that added are likely to be inconsequential for reasoning performance
added inferred axioms
However we observe instances positive effects on the used reasoner for a given ontology
However we observe instances negative effects on the used reasoner for a given ontology
However we observe instances of on the used reasoner for a given ontology
negative effects that seem to depend

These results suggest that the practice of adding inferred axioms during the release process of ontologies should be subject to a taskspecific analysis
a taskspecific analysis that determines whether desired effects are obtained
