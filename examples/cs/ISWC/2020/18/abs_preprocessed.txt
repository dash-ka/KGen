it is sometimes claimed that adding inferred axioms eg the inferred class hierarchy to an ontology can improve reasoning performance
it is sometimes claimed that adding inferred axioms eg the inferred class hierarchy to an ontology can improve an ontologys usability in practice
while such beliefs may have an effect on how ontologies are published there is no conclusive empirical evidence to support such beliefs
to develop an understanding of the impact of this practice both for tools we survey to what extent published ontologies in bioportal already contain such beliefs the inferred class hierarchy

added inferred axioms from these sets
furthermore we investigate how added can affect the performance of standard reasoning tasks such as realisation
furthermore we investigate how added can affect the performance of standard reasoning tasks such as classification
we find that most specific class assertions are highly prevalent in published biomedical ontologies
we find that axioms from the the inferred class hierarchy
we reasoning evaluation indicates that added are likely to be inconsequential for reasoning performance
added inferred axioms
negative effects that seem to depend
positive effects that seem to depend

a taskspecific analysis that determines whether desired effects are obtained
these results suggest that the practice of adding inferred axioms during the release process of ontologies should be subject to a taskspecific analysis
