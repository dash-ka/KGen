To alleviate the cold start problem knowledge graphs are increasingly employed by many methods as auxiliary resources
the cold start problem caused by collaborative filtering in recommender systems
existing work incorporated with knowledge graphs
However existing work can not capture the explicit longrange semantics between items meanwhile consider various connectivity between items
However existing work can not capture the explicit longrange semantics between users meanwhile consider various connectivity between items
RGRec which combines graph neural networks  for recommendation
RGRec which combines GNNs  for recommendation
In this paper we propose RGRec
RGRec which combines rule learning  for recommendation
RGRec first maps items to corresponding entities in knowledge graphs
RGRec first adds users as new entities
Then it automatically learns rules to model the explicit longrange semantics and captures the connectivity between entities by aggregation to better encode various information
We show the effectiveness of RGRec on three realworld datasets
Particularly the combination of rule learning and GNNs achieves substantial improvement compared to methods only using either of rule learning and GNNs
