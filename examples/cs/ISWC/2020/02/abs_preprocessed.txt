despite their largescale coverage largescale coverage crossdomain knowledge graphs invariably suffer from inherent incompleteness and sparsity
link prediction can alleviate this by inferring a target entity given a source entity
link prediction can alleviate this by inferring a target entity given a query relation
recent embeddingbased approaches operate in an uninterpretable latent semantic vector space of relations while pathbased approaches operate in the symbolic space making the inference process explainable
recent embeddingbased approaches operate in an uninterpretable latent semantic vector space of entities while pathbased approaches operate in the symbolic space making the inference process explainable
however pathbased approaches typically consider static snapshots of the knowledge graphs severely restricting pathbased approaches applicability for evolving knowledge graphs with newly emerging entities
an inductive representation learning framework
to overcome this issue we propose an inductive representation
framework that is able to learn representations of previously unseen entities
our method finds reasoning paths between source entities thereby providing support evidence for the inferred link
