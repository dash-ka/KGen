in recent years misinformation on the web has become increasingly rampant
the research community has responded by proposing systems
the research community has responded by proposing challenges
systems which are beginning to be useful for  various subtasks of  detecting misinformation
challenges which are beginning to be useful for  various subtasks of  detecting misinformation
results which are not machine readable
deep learning techniques which are finetuned to specific domains are difficult to interpret results
however most proposed systems are based on deep learning techniques
deep learning techniques which are finetuned to specific domains are difficult to produce results
this limits this applicability and adoption as this can only be used by a select expert audience in very specific settings
credibility reviews that can be used to build networks of distributed bots
distributed bots that collaborate for misinformation detection
in this paper we propose an architecture based on a core concept of credibility reviews
the credibility reviews serve as building blocks to compose graphs of web content existing credibility signals reputation reviews of websites
the credibility reviews serve as building computed reviews
the credibility reviews serve as building blocks to compose graphs of web content existing credibility signals factchecked claims of websites
