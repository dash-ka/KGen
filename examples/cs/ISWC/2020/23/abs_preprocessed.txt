the rdftotext task has recently gained substantial attention due to continuous growth of linked data
neural models which are now able to convert a set of rdf triples into text in an endtoend style with promising results
in contrast to traditional pipeline models recent studies have focused on neural models
however english is the only language widely targeted
a multilingual graphbased neural model that verbalizes rdf data to russian
a multilingual graphbased neural model that verbalizes rdf data to english
a multilingual graphbased neural model that verbalizes rdf data to german
we address this research gap by presenting nabu a multilingual graphbased neural model
an encoder inspired by graph attention networks as decoder
a multilingual graphbased neural model that verbalizes rdf data to german russian
an encoder inspired by a transformer as decoder
a multilingual graphbased neural model that verbalizes rdf data to english is based on an encoderdecoder architecture
nabu a multilingual graphbased neural model uses an encoder
we approach relies on the fact that knowledge graphs are languageagnostic
knowledge graphs hence can be used to generate multilingual text
we evaluate nabu in multilingual settings on standard benchmarking webnlg datasets
we evaluate nabu in monolingual settings on standard benchmarking webnlg datasets
a multilingual graphbased neural model that verbalizes rdf data to russian
a multilingual graphbased neural model that verbalizes rdf data to english
a multilingual graphbased neural model that verbalizes rdf data to german
we results show that nabu a multilingual graphbased neural model achieves consistent results across all languages on the multilingual scenario with 5604 bleu
we results show that nabu a multilingual graphbased neural model outperforms stateoftheart approaches on english with 6621 bleu
