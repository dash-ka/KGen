based on semantic web technologies knowledge graphs help users to discover information of interest by using live sparql services
answerseekers often modify sparql queries repeatedly in a search session
answerseekers often examine intermediate results iteratively
in this context understanding user behaviors is critical for effective intention prediction
in this context understanding user behaviors is critical for query optimization
however user behaviors have not yet been researched systematically at the sparql session level
this paper reveals secrets of session level user search behaviors by conducting a comprehensive investigation over massive realworld sparql query logs
query changes made by users regarding structural features of sparql queries
in particular we thoroughly assess query changes
query changes made by users regarding datadriven features of sparql queries
findings which might be valuable to devise efficient sparql caching
findings which might be valuable to devise relaxation techniques in the future
findings which might be valuable to devise approximation
findings which might be valuable to devise autocompletion
findings which might be valuable to devise query suggestion
to illustrate the potentiality of we findings we employ an application example of how to use we findings
