While learning new technical material a user faces difficulty
new concepts for which a user does not have the necessary prerequisite knowledge
difficulty encountering new concepts
Determining the right set of prerequisites is challenging because the right set of prerequisites involves multiple searches on the web
Although a number of techniques have been proposed to retrieve prerequisites none of a number of techniques consider grouping prerequisites into interesting facets
PreFace that automatically determines interesting facets for a given concept of interest
To address this issue we have developed a system called PreFace and determines prerequisites for the concept and facet
a retrieval model that balances the tradeoff between the relevance of the facets diversity
a retrieval model that balances the tradeoff between the relevance of the facets
The key component of PreFace is a retrieval model
a language model estimated using a domainspecific knowledge base
We achieve this by representing each facet as a language model and a large corpus of research papers and ranking research papers
ranking research papers using a riskminimization framework
We evaluation of the results over a benchmark set of queries shows that PreFace retrieves better facets and prerequisites than stateoftheart facet extraction techniques
