Tables in scientific papers contain a wealth of valuable knowledge for the scientific enterprise
To help the many of us who frequently consult this type of knowledge we present a new endtoend system to build a Knowledge Base  KB  from tables in scientific papers
To help the many of us who frequently consult this type of knowledge we present Tab2Know 
Tab2Know addresses the challenge of automatically interpreting the tables in papers
Tab2Know addresses of disambiguating the entities that the entities contain
To solve these problems we propose a pipeline
a pipeline that employs logicbased reasoning
a pipeline that employs both statisticalbased classifiers
First we pipeline applies weakly supervised classifiers to recognize the type of tables with the help of a data labeling system
First we pipeline applies weakly supervised classifiers to recognize the type of columns with the help of a data labeling system
First we pipeline applies weakly supervised classifiers to recognize the type of tables with an ontology specifically designed for our purpose
First we pipeline applies weakly supervised classifiers to recognize the type of columns with an ontology specifically designed for our purpose
Then logicbased reasoning is used to link equivalent entities  via sameAs links  in different tables
our approach using a corpus of papers in the Computer Science domain
An empirical evaluation of our approach has returned satisfactory performance
This suggests that our is a promising step to create a largescale KB of scientific knowledge
