We adapt existing approaches for privacypreserving publishing of linked data to a setting  formally existentially quantified  individuals
a setting where the data are given as Description Logic ABoxes with possibly anonymised
the privacy policies are expressed using sets of concepts of the Description Logic EL
ABoxes that are noncompliant
We provide a chacterization of compliance of such ABoxes wrt EL policies
We provide a chacterization of compliance of such ABoxes show how optimal compliant anonymisations of ABoxes can be computed
This work extends previous work on privacypreserving ontology publishing
privacypreserving ontology publishing in which a very restricted form of ABoxes called instance stores had been considered
This work restricts the attention to compliance
The approach developed here can easily be adapted to the problem of computing optimal repairs of quantified ABoxes
