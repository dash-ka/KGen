rdf is a recent w3c recommendation language for validating rdf data
constraints that enforce particular shapes on an rdf graph
specifically shacl documents are collections of constraints
previous work on the topic did not consider the standard decision problems of satisfiability
previous work on the topic has provided practical results for the validation problem
containment which are crucial for verifying the feasibility of the constraints
previous work on the topic has provided theoretical results for the validation problem
previous work on the topic did not important for design purposes
satisfiability which are crucial for verifying the feasibility of the constraints
previous work on the topic did not important for optimization purposes
previous work on the topic did not consider the standard decision problems of containment
new window that precisely captures the semantics of containment
new window that precisely captures the semantics of shacl wrt satisfiability
in this paper we undertake a thorough study of the different features of shacl by providing a translation to a new firstorder language
a new firstorder language called open image in new window
we study the interaction of shacl features in this logic
we provide the detailed map of decidability results of the aforementioned decision problems for different shacl sublanguages
we provide the detailed map of complexity results of the aforementioned decision problems for different shacl sublanguages
notably we prove that both problems are undecidable for the full language
notably we prove that we present decidable combinations of interesting features
