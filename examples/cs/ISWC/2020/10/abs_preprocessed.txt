Information Extraction tasks like disambiguating relations from unstructured text are key to automate Knowledge Graphs population
Information Extraction tasks like disambiguating entities from unstructured text are key to automate Knowledge Graphs population
However Natural Language Processing methods alone can not guarantee the validity of the facts
However Natural Language Processing methods alone may introduce erroneous information into the Knowledge Graphs
the facts extracted
an endtoend system that combines Validation techniques with Natural Language Processing methods to provide Knowledge Graphs population of novel facts from clustered news events
an endtoend system that combines Semantic Knowledge with Natural Language Processing methods to provide Knowledge Graphs population of novel facts from clustered news events
This work presents an endtoend system
These two contributions are twofold First we present a novel method for including entitytype knowledge into a Relation Extraction model improving F1Score over the baseline with TypeRE datasets
These two contributions are twofold First we present a novel method for including entitytype knowledge into a Relation Extraction model improving F1Score over the baseline with TACRED datasets
Second we increase the precision by adding data validation on top of the Relation Extraction method
These two contributions are combined in an industrial pipeline for automatic Knowledge Graphs population over aggregated news
population over aggregated news demonstrating increased data validity when performing online learning from unstructured web data
Finally the TypeRE datasets build to benchmark These two contributions are also published to foster future research in this field
