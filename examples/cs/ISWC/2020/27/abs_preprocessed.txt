with the everincreasing number of rdfbased knowledge graphs the number of interconnections between these graphs sameas property has exploded
the number of interconnections between these graphs using the owl
moreover as several works indicate the identity as defined by the semantics of owl sameas could be too rigid
moreover as several works indicate the identity as defined by the semantics of owl sameas property is therefore often misused
indeed identity must be seen as contextdependent
poor quality data when using sameas inference capabilities
these facts lead to poor quality data
poor quality data when using the owl
therefore contextual identity could be a possible path to better quality knowledge
unlike classical identity with contextual identity only certain properties can be propagated between contextually identical entities
an approach based on sentence embedding
continuing this work on contextual identity we propose an approach to find semiautomatically a set of properties for a given identity context
a given identity context that can be propagated between contextually identical entities
quantitative experiments against a gold standard show that our approach achieved promising results
the desired results that meet users needs when querying more complete and accurate answers
the use cases provided
the desired results that meet users needs when querying a knowledge graph
besides the use cases demonstrate that identifying the properties helps users achieve the desired results
the properties that can be propagated
