the number and size of rdf knowledge graphs grows continuously
efficient storage solutions for these graphs are indispensable for these graphs use in real applications
we present such a storage solution
a storage solution dubbed tentris
sparse order3 tensors using a novel data structure
a novel data structure which we dub hypertrie
we solution represents rdf knowledge graphs as sparse order3 tensors
a novel data structure which we dub hypertrie
a novel data structure then uses tensor algebra to carry out sparql queries by mapping sparql operations to einstein summation
by being able to compute einstein summations efficiently tentris outperforms the opensource rdf storage solutions evaluated in our experiments by at least 18 times with respect to the average number of queries tentris can serve per second on three datasets of up to 1 billion triples
by being able to compute einstein summations efficiently tentris outperforms the commercial rdf storage solutions evaluated in our experiments by at least 18 times with respect to the average number of queries tentris can serve per second on three datasets of up to 1 billion triples
