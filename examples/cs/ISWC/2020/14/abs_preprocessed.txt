We introduce an approach to semantically query raster data in a Semantic Web graph
We introduce an approach to semantically represent raster data in a Semantic Web graph
We extend query language to support raster data as a new type of geospatial data
We extend the GeoSPARQL vocabulary to support raster data as a new type of geospatial data
We define new filter functions
We illustrate We approach using several use cases on realworld data sets
Finally We describe a prototypical implementation
Finally We validate the feasibility of We approach
