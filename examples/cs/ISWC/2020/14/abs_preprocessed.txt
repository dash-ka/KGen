we introduce an approach to semantically represent raster data in a semantic web graph
we introduce an approach to semantically query raster data in a semantic web graph
we extend the geosparql vocabulary to support raster data as a new type of geospatial data
we extend query language to support raster data as a new type of geospatial data
we define new filter functions
we illustrate we approach using several use cases on realworld data sets
finally we validate the feasibility of we approach
finally we describe a prototypical implementation
