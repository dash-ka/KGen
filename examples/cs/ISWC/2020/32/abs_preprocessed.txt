Short text categorization is an important task in many NLP applications such as sentiment analysis news feed categorization Due to the sparsity and shortness of the text many traditional classification models perform poorly if many traditional classification models are directly applied to short text
data which is a costly task
Moreover supervised approaches require large amounts of manually labeled data
data which is a labor intensive task
data which is a timeconsuming task
a costly task proposes a weakly supervised short text categorization approach
categorization approach which does not require any manually
a timeconsuming task proposes a weakly supervised short text categorization approach
a labor intensive task proposes a weakly supervised short text categorization approach
a weakly supervised short text categorization approach labeled data
The proposed model consists of two main modules a data labeling module
data set
a classification model based on a Wide Deep learning approach
a data labeling module which leverages an external Knowledge Base to compute probabilistic labels for a classification model
a data labeling module which leverages an external Knowledge Base to compute probabilistic labels for a given unlabeled training data
The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated via evaluation on multiple datasets
The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms unsupervised stateoftheart classification approaches
The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves comparable performance to supervised approaches
