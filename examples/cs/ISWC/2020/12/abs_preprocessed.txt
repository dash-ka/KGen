clustering entities over knowledge graphs is an asset for knowledge discovery
clustering entities over knowledge graphs is an asset for explorative search
clustering entities over knowledge graph embeddings have been intensively investigated mostly for clustering entities over knowledge graph completion
clustering entities over knowledge graph embeddings have potential also for entity clustering
however embeddings do not convey userinterpretable labels for clusters
however embeddings are latent
a novel approach that combines clustering entities over knowledge graph embeddings with rule mining methods to compute informative clusters of entities along with comprehensible explanations
this work presents excut a novel approach
comprehensible explanations are in the form of concise combinations of entity relations
excut jointly enhances the quality of entity clusters in an iterative manner
an iterative manner that interleaves the learning of embeddings
an iterative manner that interleaves the learning of rules
excut jointly enhances the quality of entity clusters explanations in an iterative manner
experiments on realworld clustering entities over knowledge graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of excut for discovering entity clusters explanations
experiments on realworld clustering entities over knowledge graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of excut for discovering highquality clusters
