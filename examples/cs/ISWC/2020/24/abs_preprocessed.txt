during the last few years several knowledge graph embedding models have been devised in order to handle machine learning problems for knowledge graphs
some of the models such as symmetry show lower performance in practice than those not allowing to infer those patterns
the models which were proven to be capable of inferring relational patterns
some of the models such as transitivity show lower performance in practice than those not allowing to infer those patterns
it is often unknown what factors contribute to such performance differences among kge models in the inference of particular patterns
we develop the concept of a solution space as a factor to infer relational patterns
a factor that has a direct influence on the practical performance of knowledge graph embedding models
a factor that has knowledge graph embedding models capability
we showcase the effect of solution space on a newly proposed model
a newly proposed model dubbed spacess
we evaluate we model against stateoftheart models on a set of standard benchmarks namely freebase
we describe the theoretical considerations behind the solution space
we evaluate we model against stateoftheart models on a set of standard benchmarks namely wordnet
