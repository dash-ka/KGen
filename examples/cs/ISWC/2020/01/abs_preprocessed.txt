question answering systems are generally modelled as a pipeline
a pipeline consisting of a sequence of steps
in such a pipeline entity linking is often the first step
several entity perform entity disambiguation
several entity linking models first
several entity perform span detection
in such models errors from the span detection phase cascade to later steps
result in a drop of overall accuracy
moreover lack of gold entity spans in training data is a limiting factor for span detector training
hence the movement towards endtoend entity linking models began where no separate span detection step is involved
the popular pointer network model which achieves competitive performance
in this work we present a novel approach to endtoend entity linking by applying the popular pointer network model
we demonstrate this in we evaluation over three datasets on the wikidata knowledge graph
