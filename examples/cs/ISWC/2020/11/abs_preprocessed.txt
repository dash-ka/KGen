We propose techniques
an RDFSPARQL setting where similarity in an RDF graph is measured with respect to a set of attributes
attributes selected in the SPARQL query
techniques that support the efficient computation of multidimensional similarity joins in an RDFSPARQL setting
While similarity joins have been studied in other contexts RDF graphs present unique challenges
We discuss how a similarity join operator can be included in the SPARQL language
ways in which a similarity can be optimised
ways in which a similarity can be implemented
We discuss how a similarity join operator can investigate ways
We devise experiments to compare three similarity join algorithms over two datasets
a PostgreSQL extension that supports similarity
We results reveal that We techniques outperform DBSimJoin a PostgreSQL extension joins
