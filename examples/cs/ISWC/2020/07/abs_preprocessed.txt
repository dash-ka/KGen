In this paper we study the problem of information disclosure in ontologybased data access
PolicyProtected ontologybased data access  which extends ontologybased data access with data protection policies specified over the ontology
PolicyProtected ontologybased data access  which extends ontologybased data access with data protection policies enforced through a censor
Following previous work on Controlled Query Evaluation we introduce a function
PolicyProtected OBDA  which extends ontologybased data access with data protection policies enforced through a censor
PolicyProtected OBDA  which extends ontologybased data access with data protection policies specified over the ontology
Following previous work on Controlled Query Evaluation we introduce the framework of PolicyProtected ontologybased data access 
a function that alters answers to users queries to avoid the disclosure of protected data
Following previous work on Controlled Query Evaluation we introduce the framework of PolicyProtected OBDA 
We consider PolicyProtected OBDA systems in which the ontology is expressed in extsc owl2ql
show that query answering under censors in such a setting can be reduced to standard query answering in ontologybased data access  without data protection policies 
We consider PolicyProtected OBDA systems in which the policies are denial constraints
The basic idea of We approach is to compile the policies of a PolicyProtected OBDA system into the mapping of a standard ontologybased data access system
To this aim we analyze some notions of censor provide a new definition of censor that enables the effective realization of our idea
To this aim we analyze some notions of censor show that some notions of are not suited for the abovementioned compilation
To this aim we analyze some notions of censor proposed in the literature
our evaluated our technique over the NPD benchmark for ontologybased data access
our have implemented our technique
our results are very promising and show that controlled query evaluation in ontologybased data access can be realized in the practice by using offtheshelf ontologybased data access engines
