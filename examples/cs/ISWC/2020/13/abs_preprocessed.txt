clientside sparql query processing enables evaluating queries over rdf datasets
rdf datasets published on the web without producing high loads on the data providers servers
clients to evaluate sparql queries over sparql queries have been proposed
triple pattern fragment servers provide means to publish highly available rdf data on the web
for clients to devise efficient query plans it is key to accurately estimate join cardinalities to appropriately place physical join operators
requests submitted to the server
efficient query plans that minimize both the number of requests
requests submitted to the overall execution time
collecting accurate statistics from remote sources is a challenging task
the metadata provided by the triple pattern fragment server
clients typically rely on the metadata
however
collecting finegrained statistics from remote sources is a challenging task
addressing this shortcoming we propose a cost query optimizer to devise efficient plans
efficient plans combining both cost of query plans
addressing this shortcoming we propose a robustbased query optimizer to devise efficient plans
efficient plans combining both robustness of query plans
addressing this shortcoming we propose crop to devise efficient plans
the idea of robustness is determining the impact of join cardinality estimation errors on the cost of a query plan
the idea of robustness is determining the impact of to avoid plans where this impact is very high
in our experimental study our show that our concept of robustness improves the efficiency of query plans
in our experimental study our show that our concept of robustness complements the cost model
additionally our show that our approach outperforms existing triple pattern fragment clients in terms of overall runtime and number of requests
