knowledge base question answering systems
knowledge base question are linking modules
knowledge base question are heavily dependent on relation extraction
however the task of linking relations from text to knowledge bases faces two primary challenges the lack of training data
however the task of extracting relations from text to knowledge bases faces two primary challenges the ambiguity of natural language of training data

semantic parsing using abstract meaning representation
framework which leverages semantic parsing
to overcome two primary challenges the lack of training data we present sling
to overcome two primary challenges the ambiguity of natural language of training data we present sling
to overcome two primary challenges the lack of training data we present a relation
semantic parsing using distant supervision
to overcome two primary challenges the ambiguity of natural language of training data we present a relation
a relation linking framework
multiple approaches that capture complementary signals such as linguistic cues from the knowledge base
semantic parsing using abstract meaning representation rrb

semantic parsing using abstract meaning representation rrb
a relation integrates multiple approaches
framework which leverages semantic parsing
multiple approaches that capture complementary signals such as rich semantic representation from the knowledge base
multiple approaches that capture complementary signals such as information from the knowledge base
a relation linking framework
sling integrates multiple approaches
relation linking using qald7
relation linking using three kbqa datasets
the experiments on relation demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves stateoftheart performance on all benchmarks
