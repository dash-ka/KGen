Knowledge base question are heavily dependent on relation extraction
Knowledge base question answering systems
Knowledge base question are linking modules
However the task of extracting relations from text to knowledge bases faces two primary challenges the ambiguity of natural language of training data
However the task of linking relations from text to knowledge bases faces two primary challenges the lack of training data

semantic parsing using Abstract Meaning Representation
semantic parsing using distant supervision
framework which leverages semantic parsing
a relation linking framework
To overcome two primary challenges the ambiguity of natural language of training data we present SLING
To overcome two primary challenges the lack of training data we present SLING
To overcome two primary challenges the lack of training data we present a relation

semantic parsing using Abstract Meaning Representation RRB
a relation linking framework
a relation integrates multiple approaches
semantic parsing using Abstract Meaning Representation RRB
multiple approaches that capture complementary signals such as information from the knowledge base
SLING integrates multiple approaches
framework which leverages semantic parsing
semantic parsing using distant supervision
multiple approaches that capture complementary signals such as rich semantic representation from the knowledge base
multiple approaches that capture complementary signals such as linguistic cues from the knowledge base
relation linking using LCQuAD 10
The experiments on relation demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves stateoftheart performance on all benchmarks
