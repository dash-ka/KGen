a knowledge base that are mentioned in a text
Collective entity linking
a core natural language processing task which consists in jointly identifying the entities of a knowledge base
a text exploiting existing relations between entities within the the entities of a knowledge base
Collective entity is a core natural language processing task
a global score measuring the coherence of the set of selected entities
Stateoftheart methods typically combine local scores accounting for the similarity between mentions with a global score

In this paper we devise a novel RDFbased entity relatedness measure for global scores with important properties a novel RDFbased entity relatedness measure for global scores has a clear semantics a novel RDFbased entity relatedness measure for global scores can be calculated at reasonable computational cost through existing  bounded length  property paths between entities in an RDF the entities of a knowledge base
In this paper we devise a novel RDFbased entity relatedness measure for global scores with important properties a novel RDFbased entity relatedness measure for global scores has a clear semantics a novel RDFbased entity relatedness measure for global scores can be calculated at a novel RDFbased entity relatedness measure for global scores accounts for the transitive aspects of entity relatedness through existing  bounded length  property paths between entities in an RDF the entities of a knowledge base
Further we experimentally show with Yago that a novel RDFbased entity relatedness measure for global scores provides significant improvement over stateoftheart entity relatedness measures for the collective entity
the collective entity linking task
Further we experimentally show on the TACKBP2017 dataset that a novel RDFbased entity relatedness measure for global scores provides significant improvement over stateoftheart entity relatedness measures for the collective entity
