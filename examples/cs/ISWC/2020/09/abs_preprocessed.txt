collective entity is a core natural language processing task
collective entity linking
a text exploiting existing relations between entities within the the entities of a knowledge base
a core natural language processing task which consists in jointly identifying the entities of a knowledge base
a knowledge base that are mentioned in a text
stateoftheart methods typically combine local scores accounting for the similarity between mentions with a global score
stateoftheart methods typically combine local scores accounting for the similarity between entities with a global score
a global score measuring the coherence of the set of selected entities

in this paper we devise a novel rdfbased entity relatedness measure for global scores with important properties a novel rdfbased entity relatedness measure for global scores has a clear semantics a novel rdfbased entity relatedness measure for global scores can be calculated at a novel rdfbased entity relatedness measure for global scores accounts for the transitive aspects of entity relatedness through existing  bounded length  property paths between entities in an rdf the entities of a knowledge base
in this paper we devise a novel rdfbased entity relatedness measure for global scores with important properties a novel rdfbased entity relatedness measure for global scores has a clear semantics a novel rdfbased entity relatedness measure for global scores can be calculated at reasonable computational cost through existing  bounded length  property paths between entities in an rdf the entities of a knowledge base

further we experimentally show with yago that a novel rdfbased entity relatedness measure for global scores provides significant improvement over stateoftheart entity relatedness measures for the collective entity
further we experimentally show with basekb that a novel rdfbased entity relatedness measure for global scores provides significant improvement over stateoftheart entity relatedness measures for the collective entity
further we experimentally show on the tackbp2017 dataset that a novel rdfbased entity relatedness measure for global scores provides significant improvement over stateoftheart entity relatedness measures for the collective entity
