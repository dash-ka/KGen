we study the problem of structurebased entity alignment between knowledge graphs
the recent mainstream solutions for the problem of structurebased entity alignment between knowledge graphs rrb apply knowledge graph embedding techniques to map entities into a vector space where the similarity between entities could be measured accordingly

these methods which are mostly based on transe and the problem of structurebased entity alignment between knowledge graphs rrb variants
these methods which are mostly based on transe and the problem of structurebased entity alignment between knowledge graphs rrb variants
however these methods treat relation triples in knowledge graphs independently
entities that are implicit in the surrounding
these methods which are mostly based on its variants
entities that are far apart which we call as longterm dependencies
entities that are implicit in multihop entities
an entity which we call as shortterm differences while the other is the dependencies between entities
as a result these methods fail to capture some advanced interactions between entities one is the differences between the twohop neighborhood of an entity

entity alignment using graph neural networks respectively
a novel approach learning to capture both the longterm dependencies in knowledge graphs for entity alignment
a novel approach learning to capture both the shortterm differences in knowledge graphs for entity alignment
entity alignment using selfattention mechanisms respectively
based on the above observations this paper proposes a novel approach
our empirical study shows the superiority of our model compared with the stateoftheart methods
our empirical study conducted on four couples of realworld datasets
