KG  embedding has attracted more attention in recent years
Most KG embedding models learn from timeunaware triples
However the inclusion of temporal information besides triples would further improve the performance of a KGE model
a temporal KG embedding model which incorporates time information into entityrelation representations by using Additive Time Series decomposition
In this regard we propose ATiSE
In this regard we propose a temporal KG embedding model
Moreover considering the temporal uncertainty during the evolution of entityrelation representations over time we map the representations of temporal KGs into the space of multidimensional Gaussian distributions
The mean of each entityrelation embedding at a time step shows the current expected position whereas the current expected position covariance  which is temporally stationary  represents the current expected position temporal uncertainty
Experimental results show that ATiSE significantly outperforms the existing temporal KGE models on link prediction over four temporal KGs
