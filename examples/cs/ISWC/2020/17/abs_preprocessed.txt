a description that uniquely identifies an instance
the generation of referring expressions is one of the most extensively explored tasks in natural language generation where a description is to be provided
some recent approaches aim to discover referring expressions in knowledge graphs
to limit the search space existing approaches define quality measures based on the intuitiveness and simplicity of the discovered expressions
data linking an algorithm
data linking task reminer
in this paper we focus on referring expressions of interest for data
an algorithm tailored to automatically discover minimal referring expressions for all instances of a class in a knowledge graph
an algorithm tailored to automatically discover diverse referring expressions for all instances of a class in a knowledge graph
data linking present reminer
tools referring expressions for data
data linking substantially improve the results especially the recall without decreasing the precision
we experimentally demonstrate on several benchmark datasets that compared to existing data
existing data linking tools
datasets containing millions of facts
we also show that the reminer algorithm can scale to datasets
