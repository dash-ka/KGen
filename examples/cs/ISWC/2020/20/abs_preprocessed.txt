the shapes constraint language allows for formalizing constraints over rdf data graphs
a shape groups a set of constraints
constraints that may be fulfilled by nodes in the rdf graph
we investigate the problem of containment between the shapes constraint language shapes
one shape is contained in a second shape if every graph node also meets the constraints of the second
every graph node meeting the constraints of the first shape
to decide shape containment we map the shapes constraint language shape graphs into description logic axioms such that shape containment can be answered by description logic reasoning
the shapes constraint language for which this approach becomes complete
we identify several increasingly tight syntactic restrictions of the shapes constraint language
the shapes constraint language for which this approach becomes sound
