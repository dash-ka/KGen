large computational overhead in the use of largescale knowledge graphs have caused widespread attention to Knowledge Representation Learning  KRL  technology
The sparse data have caused widespread attention to Knowledge Representation Learning  KRL  technology
Although many KRL models have been proposed to embed structure information many KRL models ability to accurately represent newly added entities is significantly insufficient
Although many KRL models have been proposed to embed structure information many KRL models ability to accurately represent entities with few relations is significantly insufficient
In some studies the introduction of textual information has partially solved this problem
However most existing textenhanced models only consider the shallow description information of the entities
deep semantic information between words which is not optimized for long texts supplementary information like Wikipedia
However most existing textenhanced models ignore the relation mention information between entities
