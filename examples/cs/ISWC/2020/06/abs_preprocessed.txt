keyword search has been a prominent approach to querying knowledge graphs
for exploratory search tasks existing methods commonly extract subgraphs
subgraphs that are group steiner trees as answers
a group steiner tree that connects all the query keywords
however a group steiner tree may inevitably have a large graph structure in contrast to users favor to a compact answer
however a group steiner tree may not exist
however a group steiner tree may inevitably have a unfocused graph structure in contrast to users favor to a compact answer
in this paper we aim at generating relaxable subgraphs as answers
we require a computed subgraph to have a
a bounded diameter
therefore
we allow a computed subgraph to only connect an incomplete subset of query keywords
in this paper we aim at generating compact subgraphs as answers
we formulate a computed subgraph as a new combinatorial optimization problem of computing a minimally relaxed answer with a compactness guarantee
we present a novel bestfirst search algorithm
extensive experiments showed that we approach efficiently computed compact answers of high completeness
