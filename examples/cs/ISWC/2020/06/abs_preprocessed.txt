Keyword search has been a prominent approach to querying knowledge graphs
For exploratory search tasks existing methods commonly extract subgraphs
subgraphs that are group Steiner trees as answers
However a group Steiner tree may inevitably have a large graph structure in contrast to users favor to a compact answer
However a group Steiner tree may inevitably have a unfocused graph structure in contrast to users favor to a compact answer
However a group Steiner tree may not exist
a group Steiner tree that connects all the query keywords
in this paper we aim at generating relaxable subgraphs as answers
we allow a computed subgraph to only connect an incomplete subset of query keywords
a bounded diameter
we require a computed subgraph to have a
Therefore
in this paper we aim at generating compact subgraphs as answers
we present a novel bestfirst search algorithm
We formulate a computed subgraph as a new combinatorial optimization problem of computing a minimally relaxed answer with a compactness guarantee
Extensive experiments showed that We approach efficiently computed compact answers of high completeness
