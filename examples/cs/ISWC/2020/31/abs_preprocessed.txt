Ontology
Ontology matching aims at making different ontologies interoperable
While most approaches have addressed the generation of simple correspondences more expressiveness is required to better address the different kinds of ontology heterogeneities
complex correspondences that relies on the notion of competency questions for alignment
This paper presents an approach for generating complex correspondences
A alignment expresses the user knowledge needs in terms of alignment
A alignment expresses the user knowledge aims at reducing the alignment scope
The approach takes as input a set of CQAs as SPARQL queries over the source ontology
The generation of correspondences is performed by matching the subgraph from the source alignment to the lexically similar surroundings of the instances from the target ontology
Evaluation of the approach has been carried out on realword datasets
Evaluation of the approach has been carried out on both synthetically generated
