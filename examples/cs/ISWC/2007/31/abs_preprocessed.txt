This paper presents a tableau approach for deciding description logics outside the scope of OWL DL1 1
This paper presents a tableau approach for deciding description logics outside the scope of current stateoftheart tableaubased description logic systems
In particular we show that the description logic ALBO provides a basis for decision procedures for numerous other description logics with full role negation
In particular we define complete tableau calculus for the description logic ALBO
In particular we define a sound for the description logic ALBO
In particular we show that the description logic ALBO provides a basis for decision procedures for this logic with full role negation
the description logic ALBO includes full support for nominals
the description logic ALBO is the extension of ALC with the Boolean role operators inverse of range restriction operators
the description logic ALBO is the extension of ALC with the Boolean role operators inverse of domain restriction operators
the description logic ALBO is the extension of ALC with the Boolean role operators inverse of roles restriction operators
a very expressive description logic which subsumes Boolean modal logic in the twovariable fragment of firstorder logic and reasoning
the description logic ALBO is a very expressive description logic is NExpTimecomplete
a very expressive description logic which subsumes the twovariable fragment of firstorder logic and reasoning in the twovariable fragment of firstorder logic and reasoning
standard loop checking mechanisms implemented in description logic systems
An important novelty is the use of a generic unrestricted blocking rule as a replacement for standard loop checking mechanisms
An implementation of our approach exists in the extscMetTeL system
