ontologybased applications covering the complete ontologylifecycle that is intended to support software engineers in developing ontologybased applications
ontologybased applications covering the complete ontologylifecycle that is intended to support software engineers in designing ontologybased applications
in this paper we present an architecture for ontologybased applications covering the complete ontologylifecycle
we illustrate the use of the architecture in a concrete case study
a concrete case study using the neon toolkit as one implementation of the architecture
