Extracting semantic relations is of great importance for the creation of the Semantic Web content
the free text of Wikipedia using the structured content readily available in It
It is of great benefit to semiautomatically extract relations from the free text of Wikipedia
Pattern matching methods can not work well since there is not much redundancy information in Wikipedia compared to Semantic Web
Pattern matching methods that employ information redundancy
Multiclass classification methods are not reasonable since no classification of relation types is available in Wikipedia
In this paper we propose PositiveOnly Relation Extraction  for relation extraction from Wikipedia text
In this paper we propose PORE  for relation extraction from Wikipedia text
a stateoftheart positiveonly learning algorithm using transductive inference to work with fewer positive training exam ples
The core algorithm BPOL extends a stateoftheart positiveonly learning algorithm
a stateoftheart positiveonly learning algorithm using bootstrapping to work with fewer positive training exam ples
a stateoftheart positiveonly learning algorithm using strong negative identifi cation to work with fewer positive training exam ples
We conducted experiments on several relations with different amount of training data
The experimental results show that BPOL can work effectively given The experimental results significantly out per forms a multiclass SVM
The experimental results show that BPOL can work effectively given only a small amount of positive training examples a multiclass SVM
The experimental results show that BPOL can work effectively given The experimental results significantly out per forms the original positive learning approaches
The experimental results show that BPOL can work effectively given only a small amount of positive training examples the original positive learning approaches
Furthermore although PORE is applied in the context of Wiki pedia The core algorithm BPOL is a general approach for Ontology Population
Furthermore although PORE is applied in the context of Wiki pedia The core algorithm BPOL can be adapted to other domains
