Ontologies proliferate with the growth of the Semantic Web
However most of data on the Semantic Web are still stored in relational databases
Therefore it is important to establish interoperability between relational databases and ontologies for creating a Web of data
An effective way to achieve interoperability is finding mappings between relational database schemas and ontologies
In this paper we propose a new approach to discovering simple mappings between a relational database schema
In this paper we propose a new approach to discovering simple mappings between an ontology
this paper eliminates incorrect mappings via validating mapping consistency
this paper exploits simple mappings based on virtual documents
Additionally this paper called contextual mappings
contextual mappings which is useful for practical applications
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs well on several data sets from real world domains
