we study the continuous evaluation of conjunctive triple pattern queries over rdf data stored in distributed hash tables
rdf triples satisfying longstanding queries queries
in a continuous query scenario network nodes subscribe with longstanding queries
in a continuous query scenario network nodes receive answers whenever rdf triples are published
we analyze two novel query processing algorithms for this scenario properties formally
we present two novel query processing algorithms for this scenario
we performance goal is to distribute query processing load evenly
we performance goal is to incur as little network traffic as possible
we performance goal is to distribute the storage evenly
we performance goal is to have algorithms
algorithms that scale to large amounts of rdf data
we discuss the various performance tradeoffs
the various performance tradeoffs that occur through a detailed experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms
