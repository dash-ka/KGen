operations that access remote data
Many scientific problems can integrate heterogeneous data
Many scientific problems can be represented as computational workflows of operations
Many scientific problems can derive new data
Many scientific problems can analyze new data
Even when processing operations are implemented as grid services workflows are often constructed manually in languages such as BPEL
Even when the data access are implemented as web services workflows are often constructed manually in languages such as BPEL

Adding semantic descriptions of the services enables mixedinitiative composition

In most previous work semantic descriptions of the services consists of semantic types for outputs of a type for the service as a whole

While this is certainly useful we argue that is not enough to model complex data workflows
