Despite the success of the Web Ontology Language OWL the development of expressive means for querying OWL knowledge bases is still an open issue
In this paper we investigate how a very natural and desirable form of queries namely conjunctive ones can be used in conjunction with OWL such that one of the major design criteria of the latter namely decidability can be retained
More precisely we show that querying unrestricted EL is decidable
we also show that querying unrestricted EL is undecidable
we also provide a complexity analysis
