the increased availability of online knowledge has led by dynamically exploring a multitude of online ontologies
the increased availability of online knowledge has led by dynamically selecting a multitude of online ontologies
several algorithms that solve a variety of tasks by harvesting the semantic web
the increased availability of online knowledge has led to the design of several algorithms
our hypothesis is that the performance of such novel algorithms thus opens the way to a taskbased evaluation of the semantic web
our hypothesis is that the performance of such novel algorithms implicitly provides an insight into the quality of the used ontologies
our have investigated our hypothesis by studying ontology matching folksonomy enrichment
the lessons learnt about online ontologies
our have investigated our hypothesis by studying word sense disambiguation
our have investigated our hypothesis by studying the lessons
online ontologies when used to solve three tasks
our analysis complement the findings of other analysis of the the semantic web landscape
the semantic web which highlight a number of weaknesses of the semantic information available online
the semantic web which highlight a number of strengths of the semantic information available online
our analysis leads to a suit of conclusions about the status of the semantic web
