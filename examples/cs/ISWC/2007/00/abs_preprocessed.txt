RDF allow efficient storage and access to RDF statements
Applications are able to use expressive query languages in order to retrieve relevant metadata to perform different tasks
However access to metadata may not be public to just any application or service
Instead flexible mechanisms for protecting sets of RDF statements are required for many Semantic Web applications
Instead powerful mechanisms for protecting sets of RDF statements are required for many Semantic Web applications
Unfortunately current RDF stores do not provide finegrained protection
This paper presents a mechanism by which expressive policies can be specified in order to protect access to metadata in multiservice environments
This paper fills this gap
