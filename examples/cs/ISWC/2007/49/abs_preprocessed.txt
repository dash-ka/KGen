semantic search promises to provide more accurate result than presentday keyword search
however progress with semantic search has been delayed due to the complexity of progress with semantic search query languages
in this paper we explore a novel approach of adapting keywords to querying the semantic web the approach automatically translates keyword queries into formal logic queries so that end users can use familiar keywords to perform semantic search
a prototype system has been implemented in light of the approach
a prototype system named  spark 
given a keyword query spark outputs a ranked list of sparql queries as the translation result
the translation in spark consists of three major steps query ranking
the translation in spark consists of three major steps query graph construction
the translation in spark consists of three major steps term mapping
specifically a probabilistic query ranking model is proposed to select the most likely sparql query
in the experiment spark achieved an encouraging translation result
