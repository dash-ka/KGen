Automatic knowledge reuse for Semantic Web applications imposes several challenges on ontology search
relevant single ontologies which may not completely cover the specified user requirements
Existing ontology retrieval systems merely return a lengthy list of relevant single ontologies
Therefore there arises an increasing demand for a tool or algorithm with a mechanism to recommend a single
Therefore there arises combination of ontologies
Therefore there arises an increasing demand for a tool or algorithm with a mechanism to check concept adequacy of existing ontologies with respect to a user query
ontologies which can entirely fulfill the requirements
Thus this paper develops an algorithm namely combiSQORE to determine whether the available collection of ontologies is able to return a combinative ontology
a combinative ontology that guarantees query coverage
a single ontology that guarantees query coverage
Thus this paper develops an algorithm namely combiSQORE to determine whether the available collection of ontologies is able to return a single ontology
Thus this paper develops an algorithm namely combiSQORE to determine whether the available collection of ontologies is able to completely satisfy a submitted query
the returned answers based on the returned answers based on their conceptual closeness conceptual closeness
In addition this paper ranks the returned answers
the returned answers based on the returned answers based on their conceptual closeness query coverage
the returned answers based on the returned answers based on query coverage conceptual closeness
the returned answers based on the returned answers based on query coverage query coverage
The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is simple
The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient
The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective
