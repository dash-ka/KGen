An important open question in the semantic Web is the semantics of standard knowledge representation formalisms such as description logics
An important open question in the semantic Web is the semantics of standard knowledge representation formalisms such as logic programming
An important open question in the semantic Web is the precise relationship between the RDF  S  semantics
In this paper we address this issue by considering these embeddings in logic
Using these embeddings combined with existing results about various fragments of logic we establish several novel complexity results
these embeddings we consider show how techniques from deductive databases can be used for reasoning with RDF
these embeddings we consider show how techniques from description logics can be used for reasoning with RDF
Finally we consider establish the data complexity of conjunctive querying for the various RDF entailment regimes
Finally we consider querying RDF graphs
