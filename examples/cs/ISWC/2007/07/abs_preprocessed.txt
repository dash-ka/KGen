the approach of using ontology reasoning to cleanse the output of information extraction tools was first articulated in semanticlean
a limiting factor in applying the approach of using ontology reasoning to cleanse the output of information extraction tools has been that ontology reasoning to find inconsistencies does not scale to the size of data
data produced by information extraction tools
in this paper we illustrate the use of we techniques to produce a consistent subset of a knowledge base with several thousand inconsistencies
in this paper we describe techniques to scale inconsistency detection
