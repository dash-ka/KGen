We present the architecture of an endtoend semantic search engine
an endtoend semantic search engine that uses a graph data model to enable interactive query answering over interlinked data
an endtoend semantic search engine that uses a graph data model to enable interactive query answering over structured data
structured data collected from many disparate sources on the Web
interlinked data collected from many disparate sources on the Web
In particular we study distributed indexing methods for graphstructured data
In particular we study parallel query evaluation methods on a cluster of computers
provide scaleup experiments on 7 billion synthetically generated statements
we evaluate the system on a dataset with 430 million statements
430 million statements collected from the Web
