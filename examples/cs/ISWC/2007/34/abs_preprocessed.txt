The discovery of suitable Web services for a given task is one of the central operations in Serviceoriented Architectures
research on Semantic Web services aims at automating this step
For the large amount of available Web services that can be expected in the computational costs of automated discovery
semantic matchmaking become important
For the large amount of available Web services that can be expected in realworld settings
automated discovery based on semantic matchmaking
To make a discovery engine a reliable software component we must thus aim at minimizing both the mean of the duration of the discovery task
To make a discovery engine a reliable software component we must thus aim at minimizing both the variance of the duration of the discovery task
environments that exploits structural knowledge results for reducing the search space of consequent discovery operations
For this we present an extension for discovery engines in research on Semantic Web services environments
environments that exploits previous discovery results for reducing the search space of consequent discovery operations
we prototype implementation shows significant improvements when applied to the Stanford research on Semantic Web services Challenge scenario and dataset
