In this paper we address The instance migration problem
The instance migration problem arises when one wants to reclassify a set of instances of a source ontology into a semantically related target ontology
ontologies which are used to reconcile both individual level heterogeneity
ontologies which are used to reconcile both conceptual
ontologies which are used to draw the migration process
we approach exploits mappings between ontologies
a distributed description logic in which ontologies are formally encoded as DL knowledge bases and mappings as individual correspondences
we ground the approach on a distributed description logic
a distributed description logic in which ontologies are formally encoded as DL knowledge bases and mappings as bridge rules
From the theoretical side we study the task of reasoning with instance data in a distributed description logic define a correct distributed tableaux inference procedure
From the theoretical side we study the task of reasoning with instance data in a distributed description logic define a complete distributed tableaux inference procedure
From the theoretical side we study the task of reasoning with instance data in a distributed description logic composed of SHIQ ontologies
From the practical side we upgrade the DRAGO a distributed description logic define a correct distributed tableaux inference procedure reasoner for dealing with instances
From the practical side we upgrade the DRAGO a distributed description logic composed of SHIQ ontologies
From the practical side we upgrade the DRAGO a distributed description logic define further show
From the practical side we upgrade the DRAGO a distributed description logic define a complete distributed tableaux inference procedure reasoner for dealing with instances
further show how it can be used to drive the migration of instances between heterogeneous ontologies
