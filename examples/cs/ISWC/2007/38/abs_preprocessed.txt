merging of RDF models
In this paper we describe RDFSync
In this paper we describe a methodology for efficient synchronization
RDFSync is based on decomposing a model into Minimum SelfContained graphs
After deriving properties of Minimum SelfContained graphs we show how a RDF model can be represented by a list of hashes of such information fragments
After illustrating theory we show how a RDF model can be represented by a list of hashes of such information fragments
these ordered lists
The synchronization procedure here described is based on the evaluation comparison of these
The synchronization procedure here described is based on the remote comparison of these
Experimental results show that The synchronization procedure here described provides very significant savings on network traffic compared to the fileoriented synchronization of serialized RDF graphs
Finally we report the implementation of a protocol for executing The synchronization procedure here described over HTTP
Finally we provide the design
