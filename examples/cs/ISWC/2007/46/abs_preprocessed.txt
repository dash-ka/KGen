As an extension to the Semantic Web Semantic Web will not only contain textual information
As an extension to the Semantic Web Semantic Web will not only contain structured data with machine understandable semantics
While structured queries can be used to find information more precisely on the Semantic Web keyword searches are still needed to help exploit textual information
It thus becomes very important that we can combine precise structured queries with imprecise keyword searches to have a hybrid query capability
In addition due to the huge volume of information on the Semantic Web the hybrid query must be processed in a very scalable way
In this paper we define such a hybrid query capability
a hybrid query capability that combines unary treeshaped structured queries with keyword searches
We show how existing information retrieval index structures and functions can be reused to index semantic web data
the index structure using existing information retrieval engines in an scalable manner
We show how existing information retrieval index structures and functions can be reused to semantic web data textual information
the index structure using existing information retrieval engines in an efficient manner
We show how the hybrid query is evaluated on the index structure
an engine called Semplore
We implemented this existing information retrieval approach in an engine
Comprehensive experiments on Semplore performance show that Semplore is a promising approach
Semplore leads us to believe that it may be possible to evolve current web search engines to query the Semantic Web
