SAWSDL provides other Semantic Web services frameworks

SAWSDL provides a standard means  OWL for Services 
a standard means by which WSDL documents can be related to semantic descriptions such as those
SAWSDL benefits explained in connection with a particular framework

This paper is an important first step toward meeting
meeting that need with respect to OWLS
provide a rationale and guidelines for OWLS constructs use
We explain what OWLS constructs are appropriate for use with the various SAWSDL annotations
In addition We identify some ways
In addition We discuss some weaknesses of SAWSDL
some ways in which OWLS could evolve so as to integrate more smoothly with SAWSDL
