recently the world wide web consortium produced a standard set of  semantic annotations for xml schema   sawsdl 
sawsdl provides a standard means  owl for services 
a standard means by which wsdl documents can be related to semantic descriptions such as those
sawsdl provides other semantic web services frameworks
those provided by owls
we argue that the value of sawsdl can not be realized until sawsdl use is specified
sawsdl benefits explained in connection with a particular framework
meeting that need with respect to owls
this paper is an important first step toward meeting
provide a rationale and guidelines for owls constructs use
we explain what owls constructs are appropriate for use with the various sawsdl annotations
in addition we discuss some weaknesses of sawsdl
in addition we identify some ways
some ways in which owls could evolve so as to integrate more smoothly with sawsdl
