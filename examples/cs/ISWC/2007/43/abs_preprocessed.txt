the areas in which human reasoning is particularly difficult
two studies in this paper demonstrate that people are predisposed to use classinclusion labels for inductive judgments
this tendency appears to stem from a this general characteristic of human reasoning using heuristics to solve problems
interface designs that incorporate human reasoning need to integrate this general characteristic underlying human induction
