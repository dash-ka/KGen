metadata conforming to heterogeneous schemas semantically interoperable
this paper presents a method for making metadata
the knowledge embedded in the schema structures explicit by transforming the schemas into a shared eventbased representation of knowledge about the real world
the knowledge embedded in the schema structures interoperable by transforming the schemas into a shared eventbased representation of knowledge about the real world
the idea is to make the knowledge
