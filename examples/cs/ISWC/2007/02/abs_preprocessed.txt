while technologies for multimedia existing descriptions already exist there is as yet no formal description of a high quality multimedia ontology
a high quality multimedia ontology that is compatible with existing web technologies
the problem using an annotation scenario
we explain the complexity of the problem
we then derive a number of requirements for specifying a formal multimedia ontology before we evaluate comm with respect to we requirements
we then derive a number of requirements for specifying a formal multimedia ontology before we present comm
we then derive a number of requirements for specifying a formal multimedia ontology before we present the developed ontology 
we then derive a number of requirements for specifying a formal multimedia ontology before we evaluate the developed ontology  with respect to we requirements
multimedia annotations that conform to comm
we provide an api for generating multimedia annotations
