a high quality multimedia ontology that is compatible with existing web technologies
While technologies for multimedia existing descriptions already exist there is as yet no formal description of a high quality multimedia ontology
the problem using an annotation scenario
We explain the complexity of the problem
We then derive a number of requirements for specifying a formal multimedia ontology before We present the developed ontology 
We then derive a number of requirements for specifying a formal multimedia ontology before We evaluate the developed ontology  with respect to We requirements
We then derive a number of requirements for specifying a formal multimedia ontology before We evaluate COMM with respect to We requirements
We then derive a number of requirements for specifying a formal multimedia ontology before We present COMM
We provide an API for generating multimedia annotations
multimedia annotations that conform to COMM
