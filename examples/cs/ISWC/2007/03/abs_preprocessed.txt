In open environments ontology mapping provides interoperability between interacting actors
In distributed environments ontology mapping provides interoperability between interacting actors
However conventional mapping systems focus on acquiring static information
whole ontologies which is infeasible in open systems
However conventional mapping systems focus on mapping whole ontologies
This paper shows that the interactions the interactions themselves between the actors between the interactions themselves between the actors can be used to predict mappings simplifying dynamic ontology mapping
similar conventions and patterns which can be analysed
The intuitive idea is that similar interactions follow similar conventions and patterns
The computed model can be used to suggest the possible mappings for the exchanged messages in new interactions
The suggestions can be evaluate by any standard ontology matcher if The suggestions are accurate the matchers avoid evaluating mappings unrelated to the interaction
