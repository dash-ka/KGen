in recent years controlled natural language  has received much attention with regard to ontologybased knowledge acquisition systems
in recent years cnl  has received much attention with regard to ontologybased knowledge acquisition systems
cnls as subsets of natural languages can be useful for both humans and computers by eliminating ambiguity of natural languages
rdf  triples using a domainspecific ontology as natural languagelike narratives lrb resource description framework rrb triples language constituents

our previous work ontopath proposed to edit natural languagelike narratives
natural languagelike narratives that are structured in rdf
natural languagelike narratives that are structured in rdf  triples
natural languagelike narratives that are structured in resource description framework  triples
however other systems have difficulties in enlarging the expression capacity
other systems employing cfg for grammar definition
however our previous work have difficulties in enlarging the expression capacity
cfgld  that includes sequential structures of the grammars
a newly developed editor which our propose in this paper
a newly developed editor permits grammar definitions through contextfree grammar with lexical dependency 
a newly developed editor permits grammar definitions through cfgld 
contextfree grammar with lexical dependency  that includes semantic structures of the grammars
cfgld  that includes semantic structures of the grammars
contextfree grammar with lexical dependency  that includes sequential structures of the grammars
cfg describing the sequential structure of grammar
with cfg lexical dependencies between sentence elements can be designated in the definition system
through the defined grammars translates the content into rdf triples
through the defined grammars the implemented editor guides users narratives in more familiar expressions with a domainspecific ontology
