Natural language interfaces offer endusers a convenient option for querying ontologybased knowledge bases
Natural language interfaces offer endusers a familiar option for querying ontologybased knowledge bases
Several studies have shown that Several studies can achieve high retrieval performance
Several studies have shown that Several studies can achieve domain independence
This paper focuses on usability
This paper investigates if NLIs are useful from an endusers point of view
To that end we introduce four interfaces each allowing a different query language
To that end we introduce four interfaces each present a usability study benchmarking four interfaces
The results of a usability study confirm that NLIs are useful for querying Semantic Web data
The results of a usability study reveal a clear preference for full sentences as query language
