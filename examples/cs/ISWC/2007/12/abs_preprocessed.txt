obo is an ontology language
an ontology language that has often been used for modeling ontologies in the life sciences
obo definition is relatively informal so in this paper we provide a clear specification for obo syntax and semantics via a mapping to owl
a mapping also allows us to apply existing semantic web tools
a mapping also allows us to apply techniques to obo
we show that semantic web reasoners can be used to efficiently reason with obo ontologies
furthermore we show that grounding the obo language in formal semantics is useful for the ontology development process using an owl reasoner we detected a likely modeling error in one obo ontology
