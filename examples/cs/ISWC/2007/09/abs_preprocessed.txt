RDF graph matching expecting making more Wikipedians
In this paper we use RDF graphs to model the key elements in the current Wikipedia authoring and propose an integrated solution to make the current Wikipedia authoring easier based on RDF graph matching
a category suggestion module that helps the user place articles in correct categories
2  a category suggestion module that helps the user place 2
1  a link suggestion module that autocompletes internal links between the current Wikipedia articles for the user 2  a category suggestion module RRB
we solution facilitates semantics reuse and provides users with 1  a link suggestion module a category suggestion module
1  a link suggestion module that suggests internal links between the current Wikipedia articles for the user 2  a category suggestion module RRB
experimental results show significant improvements over existing solutions to category suggestion tasks
experimental results show significant improvements over existing solutions to link suggestion tasks
A prototype system is implemented
The proposed enhancements can be applied to relieve the burden of professional editors thus enhancing the current Wikipedia to make the current Wikipedia an even better Semantic Web data source
The proposed enhancements can be applied to attract more contributors
