the current wikipedia has embraced the power of collaborative editing to harness collective intelligence
the current wikipedia can also serve as an ideal semantic web data source due to high quality
the current wikipedia can also serve as an ideal semantic web data source due to influence
the current wikipedia can also serve as an ideal semantic web data source due to the current wikipedia abundance
the current wikipedia can also serve as an ideal semantic web data source due to wellstructuring
however the heavy burden of upbuilding still rests on a very small group of people
however the heavy burden of maintaining such an enormous and evergrowing online encyclopedic knowledge base still rests on a very small group of people
many casual users may still feel difficulties in writing high quality the current wikipedia articles
in this paper we use rdf graphs to model the key elements in the current wikipedia authoring and propose an integrated solution to make the current wikipedia authoring easier based on rdf graph matching
rdf graph matching expecting making more wikipedians
we solution facilitates semantics reuse and provides users with 1  a link suggestion module a category suggestion module
a category suggestion module that helps the user place articles in correct categories
1  a link suggestion module that suggests internal links between the current wikipedia articles for the user 2  a category suggestion module rrb
1  a link suggestion module that autocompletes internal links between the current wikipedia articles for the user 2  a category suggestion module rrb
2  a category suggestion module that helps the user place 2
a prototype system is implemented
experimental results show significant improvements over existing solutions to link suggestion tasks
experimental results show significant improvements over existing solutions to category suggestion tasks
the proposed enhancements can be applied to relieve the burden of professional editors thus enhancing the current wikipedia to make the current wikipedia an even better semantic web data source
the proposed enhancements can be applied to attract more contributors
