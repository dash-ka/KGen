the amount of meta data available on the semantic web is constantly growing
the amount of ontologies available on the semantic web is constantly growing
the successful application of machine learning techniques for learning of ontologies from textual data ie mining for the semantic web contributes to this trend
however no principal approaches exist so far for mining from the semantic web
we investigate how machine can be made amenable for directly taking advantage of the rich knowledge
machine learning algorithms
the rich knowledge expressed in ontologies
the rich knowledge expressed in associated instance data
various learning tasks
kernel methods have been provide a clean framework for interfacing between nonvectorial data
kernel methods have been successfully employed in various
kernel methods have been provide a clean framework for interfacing between machine learning algorithms
in this spirit we express the problem of mining instances in ontologies as the problem of defining valid corresponding kernels
we present a principled framework for designing such kernels by means of decomposing the kernel computation into specialized kernels for selected characteristics of an ontology
an ontology which can be tuned
an ontology which can be flexibly assembled
