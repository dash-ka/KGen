Hierarchical classifications are used pervasively by humans as a means to organize Hierarchical classifications data about the world
natural language labels used to describe Hierarchical classifications contents
One of their main advantages is that natural language labels are easily understood by human users
However at the same time this is also one of their main disadvantages as natural language labels are very hard to be reasoned about by software agents
natural language labels used to describe their contents
However at the same time this is also one of their main disadvantages as natural language labels are ambiguous
This fact creates an insuperable hindrance for classifications to being embedded in the Semantic Web infrastructure
the main NLP problems related to the conversion process
these problems which are especially effective in this domain
This paper presents an approach to converting classifications into lightweight ontologies and This paper makes the following contributions This paper identifies the main NLP problems This paper proposes heuristic solutions to these problems and This paper evaluates the proposed solutions by testing the main NLP problems
