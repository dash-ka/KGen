Current information retrieval approaches provide a comfortable way for the user to specify information needs on the basis of keywords
Current information retrieval approaches do not formally capture the explicit meaning of a keyword query
Ontologybased approaches impose a query syntax more difficult to handle
Ontologybased approaches allow for sophisticated semantic search
In this paper we present an approach for translating keyword queries to DL conjunctive queries using background knowledge available in ontologies
an implementation which shows that this interpretation of keywords can then be used for both exploration of for a semanticsbased declarative query answering process
We present an implementation
an implementation which shows that this interpretation of keywords can then be used for both exploration of asserted knowledge
We also present an evaluation of a discussion of the limitations of the approach with respect to We underlying assumptions
underlying assumptions which directly points to issues for future work
We also present an evaluation of We system to We underlying assumptions
