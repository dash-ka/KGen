the ability to compute the differences is an important step to cope with the evolving nature of the semantic web
the differences that exist between two rdf models
data that need to be managed over the network
in particular rdf deltas can be employed to reduce the amount of data advanced the semantic web synchronization
in particular rdf deltas can be employed to reduce the amount of data advanced versioning services
data that need to build
data that need to be exchanged over the network
formally analyze the underlying change operations possible combinations in terms of redundancy properties
in this paper we study various rdf comparison functions in conjunction with the semantics of the underlying change operations
by considering deltas as sets of change operations
formally analyze the underlying change operations possible combinations in terms of correctness minimality semantic identity
