This paper shows that the interactions the interactions themselves between the actors between the interactions themselves between the actors can be used to predict mappings simplifying dynamic ontology mapping
This problem has received a lot of research attention however the research emphasis has been mostly devoted to automating the mapping process even though the creation of mappings often involve the user
This research explores three SPARQLbased techniques to solve Semantic Web tasks
This simplifies accurate reasoning services such as crossdomain semantic search browsing
This simplifies accurate reasoning services such as crossdomain semantic search recommending
This tendency appears to stem from a this general characteristic of human reasoning using heuristics to solve problems
