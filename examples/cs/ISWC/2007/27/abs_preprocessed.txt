ontologies play a core role in the success of the semantic web as the semantic web provide a shared vocabulary for different resources and applications
developing an errorfree ontology is a difficult task
a common kind of error for an ontology is logical contradiction or incoherence
in this paper we propose some approaches to measuring incoherence in dlbased ontologies
these measures give an ontology engineer important information for evaluating ontologies
these measures give an ontology engineer important information for maintaining ontologies
we implement the proposed approaches but encouraging empirical results
we provide some preliminary but encouraging empirical results
