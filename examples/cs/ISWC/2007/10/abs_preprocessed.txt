this paper presents a controlled language for ontology editing
this paper presents a software implementation
a software implementation based partly on standard nlp tools for processing that language
a software implementation based partly on standard nlp tools for processing that manipulating an ontology
the input sentences are analysed compositionally with respect to a given ontology this allows the user to learn fewer syntactic structures since some of fewer syntactic structures can be used to refer to either classes for example
the input sentences are analysed deterministically with respect to a given ontology this allows the user to learn fewer syntactic structures since some of fewer syntactic structures can be used to refer to either instances for example

a given ontology which the software consults in order to interpret the inputs semantics
a repeatedmeasures taskbased evaluation has been carried out in comparison with a wellknown ontology editor the software received favourable results for basic tasks
this paper also discusses work in future plans for developing this language and tool
this paper also discusses work in progress plans for developing this language and tool
