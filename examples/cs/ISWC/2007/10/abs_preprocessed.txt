This paper presents a controlled language for ontology editing
This paper presents a software implementation
The input sentences are analysed deterministically with respect to a given ontology this allows the user to learn fewer syntactic structures since some of fewer syntactic structures can be used to refer to either instances for example
The input sentences are analysed compositionally with respect to a given ontology this allows the user to learn fewer syntactic structures since some of fewer syntactic structures can be used to refer to either instances for example
The input sentences are analysed deterministically with respect to a given ontology this allows the user to learn fewer syntactic structures since some of fewer syntactic structures can be used to refer to either classes for example
a given ontology which the software consults in order to interpret the inputs semantics
The input sentences are analysed compositionally with respect to a given ontology this allows the user to learn fewer syntactic structures since some of fewer syntactic structures can be used to refer to either classes for example
A repeatedmeasures taskbased evaluation has been carried out in comparison with a wellknown ontology editor the software received favourable results for basic tasks
