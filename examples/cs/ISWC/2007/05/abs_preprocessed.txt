Ontology design patterns are the extension of software patterns for knowledge acquisition in the Semantic Web
In this work we present a design pattern for representing relevance depending on context in OWL ontologies ie to assert which knowledge from the domain ought to be considered in a given scenario
Besides the formal semantics we describe a reasoning procedure to extract relevant knowledge in the resulting ontology
Besides the features of the pattern we describe a reasoning procedure to extract relevant knowledge in a plugin for Protege pattern use
