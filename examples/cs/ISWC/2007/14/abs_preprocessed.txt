in this paper we present a solution for  weaving the claim web  ie the creation of knowledge networks via socalled claims stated in scientific publications
scientific publications created with the salt  semantically annotated  framework
to attain this objective we provide support for claim identification
to attain this objective we defined reference mechanism
to attain this objective we evolved the appropriate ontologies
to attain this objective we defined a claim citation
a prototypical claim search engine which allows to reference to existing claims and hence weave the web
we also describe a prototypical claim search engine
finally we performed a smallscale evaluation of the salt lrb semantically annotated rrb framework with a quite promising outcome
