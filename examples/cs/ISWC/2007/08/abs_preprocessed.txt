ontology mapping is the key to data interoperability in the semantic web
this problem has received a lot of research attention however the research emphasis has been mostly devoted to automating the mapping process even though the creation of mappings often involve the user
as industry interest in semantic web technologies grows we must begin to support the user
as the number of widely adopted semantic web applications increases we must begin to support the user
in this paper we combine data
data gathered from theories of cognitive support to propose a theoretical framework for cognitive support in ontology mapping tools
data gathered from theories of decision making to propose a theoretical framework for cognitive support in ontology mapping tools
data gathered from background literature to propose a theoretical framework for cognitive support in ontology mapping tools
data gathered from an observational case study to propose a theoretical framework for cognitive support in ontology mapping tools
a tool called cogz
we also describe a tool
cogz that is based on this framework
