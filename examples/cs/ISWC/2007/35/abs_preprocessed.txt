many of these ontologies contain overlapping information
in different areas these ontologies have been developed
often we would therefore want to be able to use multiple ontologies
to obtain good results we need to find the relationships between terms in the different ontologies ie we need to align the different ontologies
currently there already exist a number of different alignment strategies
a user that needs to align two ontologies to decide which of the different available strategies are the most suitable
however it is usually difficult for a user
a method that provides recommendations on alignment strategies for a given alignment problem
in this paper we propose a method
a method that provides recommendations on alignment strategies for a given alignment problem
a method uses the evaluation of the different available alignment strategies results to provide recommendations
a method is based on the evaluation of the different available alignment strategies on several small selected pieces from the ontologies
a method that provides recommendations on alignment strategies for a given alignment problem
illustrate
discuss a method
in this paper we give the basic steps of a method
a method that provides recommendations on alignment strategies for a given alignment problem in the setting of an alignment problem with two wellknown biomedical ontologies
a method that provides recommendations on alignment strategies for a given alignment problem
we also experiment with different implementations of the steps in a method
