Finding the justifications of an entailment  that is all the minimal set of axioms sufficient to produce an entailment  has emerged as a key inference service for the Web Ontology Language
Justifications are essential for debugging unsatisfiable classes and contradictions
The availability of justifications as explanations of entailments improves the understandability of complex ontologies
The availability of justifications as explanations of entailments improves the understandability of large ontologies
In this paper we present several algorithms for computing all the justifications of an entailment in an OWLDL Ontology and show by an empirical evaluation that even a reasoner independent approach works well on real ontologies
