the development of ontologies involves relatively small modifications
the development of ontologies involves continuous modifications
existing ontology reasoners however do not take advantage of the similarities between different versions of an ontology
reasoning that reuses information
in this paper we propose a technique for incremental reasoning that is reasoning  based on the notion of a module
information obtained from previous versions of an ontology
we technique does not depend can be used in combination with any reasoner
we technique does not depend on a particular reasoning calculus
we have applied we found significant improvement over regular classification time on a set of realworld ontologies
we have applied we results to incremental classification of owl dl ontologies
