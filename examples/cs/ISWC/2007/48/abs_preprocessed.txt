This paper deals with the problem of exploring hierarchical semantics from social annotations
Recently social annotation services have become more popular in Semantic Web
Recently social annotation services have become more popular in Semantic Web
social annotation services allows users to arbitrarily annotate web resources thus largely lowers the barrier to cooperation
Furthermore through providing abundant metadata resources social annotation might become a key to the development of Semantic Web
However on the other hand social annotation has 2  lack of hierarchical information
However on the other hand social annotation has 1  ambiguity and synonym phenomena
However on the other hand social annotation has the other hand own apparent limitations for instance
In This paper we propose an unsupervised model to automatically derive hierarchical semantics from social annotations
the derived hierarchical semantics
Using a social bookmark service Delicious as example we demonstrate that the has the ability to compensate those shortcomings
We further apply We model on another data set from Flickr to testify We models applicability on different environments
The experimental results demonstrate our models efficiency
