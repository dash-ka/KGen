base founded on formal logic
the logicbased semantic web presents the vision of a distributed dynamically growing knowledge base
Common users however seem to have problems even with the simplest Boolean expressions
As queries from web search engines show the great majority of users simply do not use Boolean expressions
So how can we help users to query a web of logic that users do not seem to understand
We address this problem by presenting a natural language interface to semantic web querying
a natural language interface allows formulating queries in a subset of natural English
a natural language interface allows formulating queries in Attempto Controlled English 
Each Attempto Controlled English query is translated into a discourse representation structure a variant of the language of firstorder logic
a discourse representation structure a variant of the language of firstorder logic that is then translated into an N3based semantic web querying language
an N3based semantic web querying language using an ontologybased rewriting framework
As the validation shows We approach offers great potential for bridging the gap between the logicbased semantic web since the logicbased semantic web allows users to query the logicbased semantic web without having to learn an unfamiliar formal language

Furthermore We found that users liked We approach
good queries resulting in a very good retrieval performance  100
