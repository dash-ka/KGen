every knowledge based system
ontologies are today a key part of every knowledge
precisely defined terms
ontologies provide a source of shared
terms resulting in system interoperability by knowledge sharing and reuse
unfortunately the variety of ways that a domain can be conceptualized results in the creation of different ontologies with overlapping parts
unfortunately the variety of ways that a domain can be conceptualized results in the creation of different ontologies with contradicting parts
for this reason ontologies need to be brought into mutual agreement  aligned 
one important method for ontology alignment is the comparison of class names of ontologies
ontologies using stringdistance metrics
one important method for ontology alignment is the comparison of property names of ontologies
today quite a lot of such metrics exist in literature
poor performance when applied in this new domain
but all of them have been initially developed for different applications and fields resulting in poor performance
names which performs better to many other field matching problems
in the current paper we present a new string metric for the comparison of names
names which performs better on the process of ontology alignment
