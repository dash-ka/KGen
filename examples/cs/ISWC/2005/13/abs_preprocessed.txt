Semantic Web knowledge encoded in RDF documents on the Web
Swoogle helps software agents
Semantic Web knowledge encoded in OWL documents on the Web
knowledge engineers find Semantic Web knowledge
Navigating such a Semantic Web on the Web is difficult due to the paucity of explicit hyperlinks beyond the namespaces in URIrefs and the few interdocument links like rdfs seeAlso imports

a novel Semantic Web navigation model providing additional navigation paths through Swoogles search services such as the Ontology Dictionary
In order to solve this issue this paper proposes a novel Semantic Web navigation model
Using a novel Semantic Web navigation model providing additional navigation paths through Swoogles search services such as the Ontology Dictionary we have developed algorithms for ranking the importance of the Web objects at three levels of granularity RDF graphs

Experiments show that Swoogle outperforms conventional web search engine in thus promoting the use and emergence of consensus ontologies
Experiments show that Swoogle outperforms other ontology libraries in finding more ontologies ranking Experiments importance
