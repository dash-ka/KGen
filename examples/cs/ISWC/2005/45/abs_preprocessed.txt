Coordination is the process of managing the possible interactions between activities a mechanism to handle such interactions is known as a coordination regime
Coordination is the process of managing the possible interactions between processes a mechanism to handle such interactions is known as a coordination regime
A successful coordination regime will prevent negative interactions occurring  eg by preventing two processes from simultaneously accessing a nonshareable resource  will facilitate positive interactions  eg by 
eg by ensuring that activities are not needlessly duplicated
A successful coordination regime will prevent negative interactions wherever possible will facilitate positive interactions  eg by 
We start from the premise that effective coordination mechanisms require the sharing of knowledge about resources properties and hence that in a heterogeneous environment an ontological approach to coordination is appropriate

After surveying recent work on dynamic coordination We describe an ontology for coordination that We have developed with the goal of coordinating semantic web processes
We then present a implementation of We ideas
We ideas which serves as a proof of concept for how an ontology for coordination can be used for dynamic coordination
We conclude with a summary of the presented work provide insights into future extensions
We conclude with a summary of the presented work illustrate the presented work relation to the Semantic Web
