As more of these workflows are built scientists start reusing standalone compositions of workflow fragments
As more of these workflows are built scientists start reusing standalone compositions of services
As more of these workflows are built scientists start sharing standalone compositions of workflow fragments

scientists repurpose an existing workflow by making small changes to a new workflow for a different purpose
scientists repurpose workflow fragment by making small changes to a new workflow for a different purpose
one that is close enough to be the basis of a new workflow for a different purpose
scientists repurpose workflow fragment by finding one
scientists repurpose an existing workflow by finding one
Such a  workflow by example  approach could help bootstrap the Web of Science
Such a  workflow by example  approach complements the popular view in the Semantic Web Services literature that online processes are constructed automatically from scratch
Based on a comparison of eScience middleware projects this paper identifies seven bottlenecks to scalable reuse and repurposing
We include some thoughts on the applicability of using the ranking of fragments
We include some thoughts on the applicability of using workflow fragment discovery
We include some thoughts on the applicability of using OWL for two bottlenecks
