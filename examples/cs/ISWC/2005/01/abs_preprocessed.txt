a future where computer programs  can make sense by assigning common  meaning  to the millions of phrases used in billions of documents
The World Wide Web envisions a future
a future where computer programs  can make sense by assigning common  meaning  to the millions of terms used in billions of documents
a future where applications  can make sense by assigning common  meaning  to the millions of terms used in billions of documents
a future where computer programs  can make more productive use of all the information on The World Wide Web by assigning common  meaning  to the millions of phrases used in billions of documents

AI representation must rise to the occasion and work with decentralized representations
AI representation must rise to the occasion and work with incompleteness
AI representation must rise to the occasion and work with imprecision
knowledge representation must rise to the occasion and work with decentralized representations
knowledge representation must rise to the occasion and work with incompleteness
knowledge representation must rise to the occasion and work with imprecision
we have made good progress in Standard webbased representations design
Standard webbased representations are an essential enabler
unstructured information that is information without explicit semantics on the other hand has proven to be both profitable to the point that there is a B search advertising industry
But here there is a big leap of faith The World Wide Web has grown at startling rates because humans are prolific at producing enormous volumes of unstructured information
But we still rely on humans to assign semantics The World Wide Web has grown at startling rates because humans are prolific at producing enormous volumes of unstructured information
the other hand navigating this mass of information
unstructured information that is information without explicit semantics on the other hand has proven to be both possible
a B search advertising industry is is not practical to expect the same will automatically happen for semantically enriched content
And yet we need semantics to better leverage the huge value on The World Wide Web
