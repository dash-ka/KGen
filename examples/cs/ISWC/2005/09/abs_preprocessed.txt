in this paper ritroverai is presented
a system  addressing the general problem of enriching a multimedia news stream with semantic metadata
news metadata here are explicitly derived from implicitly expressed into a topical category automatically detected
news metadata here are explicitly derived from transcribed sentences
the enrichment process is accomplished by searching the same news
the same news expressed by different agencies reachable over the web
metadata extraction from the alternative sources  is similarly applied
integration of the sources  according to some heuristic of pertinence  is carried out
metadata extraction from ie web pages  is similarly applied
performance evaluation of the current system prototype has been carried out on a large scale
performance evaluation of the current system prototype confirms the viability of the ritroverai approach for ie 24 hours  applications
performance evaluation of the current system prototype confirms the viability of metadata extraction from multimedia news data
performance evaluation of the current system prototype confirms the viability of continuous monitoring from multimedia news data
performance evaluation of the current system prototype confirms the viability of the ritroverai approach for realistic  applications
