RitroveRAI addressing the general problem of enriching a multimedia news stream with semantic metadata
In this paper RitroveRAI is presented
News metadata here are explicitly derived from transcribed sentences
News metadata here are explicitly derived from implicitly expressed into a topical category automatically detected
the same news expressed by different agencies reachable over the Web
The enrichment process is accomplished by searching the same news
Metadata extraction from ie Web pages  is similarly applied
Metadata extraction from the alternative sources  is similarly applied
integration of the sources  according to some heuristic of pertinence  is carried out
Performance evaluation of the current system prototype has been carried out on a large scale
Performance evaluation of the current system prototype confirms the viability of the RitroveRAI approach for ie 24 hours  applications
Performance evaluation of the current system prototype confirms the viability of the RitroveRAI approach for realistic  applications
Performance evaluation of the current system prototype confirms the viability of continuous monitoring from multimedia news data
