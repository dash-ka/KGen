In this paper The proposed method is proposed in which sensitive data in an RDFgraph is encrypted for a set of recipients while all nonsensitive data remain publicly readable
The result is an RDFcompliant selfdescribing graph
an RDFcompliant selfdescribing graph containing encrypted data
an RDFcompliant selfdescribing graph containing encryption metadata
an RDFcompliant selfdescribing graph containing plaintext data
For the representation of encryption metadata XMLSignature recommendations are used
For the representation of encrypted data XMLSignature recommendations are used
For the representation of encrypted data the XMLEncryption are used
For the representation of encryption metadata the XMLEncryption are used
The proposed method allows for finegrained encryption of arbitrary subjects predicates subgraphs of an RDFgraph
The proposed method allows for finegrained encryption of arbitrary subjects predicates objects of an RDFgraph
An XML vocabulary for specifying encryption policies is introduced
