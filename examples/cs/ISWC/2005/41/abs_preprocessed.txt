a new ontology evolution approach that combines a an automatic change detection mechanism approach
In this article we propose a new ontology evolution approach
a new ontology evolution approach that combines a changes
This means that the manual request for changes by the ontology engineer is complemented with an automatic change detection mechanism
a an automatic change detection mechanism approach is based on keeping track of the different versions of ontology concepts throughout track of the different versions of ontology concepts lifetime  called virtual versions 
a new ontology evolution approach is based on keeping track of the different versions of ontology concepts throughout track of the different versions of ontology concepts lifetime  called virtual versions 
a new ontology evolution approach that combines a changes
In this way changes can be defined in terms of these virtual versions
