domain ontologies very rarely model verbs as relations
however the role of the verb as a central is undeniable
a central connecting element between concepts
verbs specify the interaction between the participants of some action or event by expressing relations between verbs
two classes that specify range
two classes that specify domain
in parallel it can be argued from an ontology engineering point of view that verbs express a relation between two classes

the effective debugging of ontologies is an important prerequisite for ontologies successful application

the practical feasibility of our method is shown by extensive test evaluationsa framework based on logic programming
we introduce a framework for preferential reasoning with agents on the semantic web
a logic program equipped with call literals
initially we encode the knowledge of an agent as a logic program
such call literals enable an agent to pose yesno queries to arbitrary knowledge sources on the semantic web without the representation language of those sources
such call literals enable an agent to pose yesno queries to arbitrary knowledge sources on the semantic web without conditions on
the extended answer set semantics
as those conflicts may arise from reasoning with different knowledge sources we use the extended answer
semantics which can provide different strategies for solving those conflicts
allowing in addition for an agent to express its preference for the satisfaction of certain rules over others we can then induce a preference order on those strategies
however since it is natural for an agent to believe it own knowledge  encoded in the program  it can alternatively express preferences on call literals
however since it consider some sources more reliable than others it can alternatively express preferences on call literals
finally we show how an agent can learn preferences on call literals if an agent is part of a web of trusted agentsto make the semantic web a reality such data needs to be interpreted with respect to ontologies
much data is published on the web in xml format satisfying schemas
interpretation is achieved through a semantic mapping between the xml schema
interpretation is achieved through a semantic mapping between the ontology
we present work on the heuristic construction of complex such semantic mappings
semantic mappings when given an initial set of simple correspondences from xml schema attributes to datatype properties in the ontology
to accomplish this we first offer a mapping formalism to capture the semantics of xml schemas
second we present we heuristic mapping construction algorithm
finally we show through an empirical study that considerable effort can be saved when constructing complex mappings by using we prototype toolbase founded on formal logic
the logicbased semantic web presents the vision of a distributed dynamically growing knowledge base
common users however seem to have problems even with the simplest boolean expressions
as queries from web search engines show the great majority of users simply do not use boolean expressions
so how can we help users to query a web of logic that users do not seem to understand
we address this problem by presenting a natural language interface to semantic web querying
a natural language interface allows formulating queries in a subset of natural english
a natural language interface allows formulating queries in attempto controlled english 
an n3based semantic web querying language using an ontologybased rewriting framework
each attempto controlled english query is translated into a discourse representation structure a variant of the language of firstorder logic
a discourse representation structure a variant of the language of firstorder logic that is then translated into an n3based semantic web querying language
as the validation shows we approach offers great potential for bridging the gap between the logicbased semantic web since the logicbased semantic web allows users to query the logicbased semantic web without having to learn an unfamiliar formal language

studies have shown that visitors can draw on visitors museum experience long after visitors visit to learn new things in practical situations
rather than viewing a visit as a single learning event we are interested in ways of extending the experience to allow visitors to access online resources
access online resources tailored to visitors interests
museums typically have extensive archives the challenge is to match these resources to the visitors interests and present in a manner that facilitates exploration

the applicability of the approach to the broader semantic web is discussed

a system is discussed
this approach which is in use in a uk museuma common practice in conceptual modeling is to separate the intensional from the extensional model
many complex domains where the borderline between the two models is not clearcut
although very intuitive this approach is inadequate for many complex domains
therefore the most expressive of the semantic web ontology languages allows combining the intensional by a feature we refer to as metamodeling
therefore owlfull  allows combining the intensional by a feature we refer to as metamodeling
therefore owlfull  allows combining the extensional model by a feature we refer to as metamodeling

recently there have been a number of proposals for languages for expressing web service constraints and capabilities with wspolicy
wspolicy leading the way
wspl leading the way
the proposed languages although relatively inexpressive suffer from a lack of formal semantics
in this paper we provide a mapping of wspolicy to the description logic fragment species of the web ontology language
in this paper we describe how standard the web ontology language reasoners can be used to check policy conformance
in this paper we describe how standard the web ontology language reasoners can be used to perform an array of policy analysis tasks

a new ontology evolution approach that combines a an automatic change detection mechanism approach
a new ontology evolution approach that combines a changes
this means that the manual request for changes by the ontology engineer is complemented with an automatic change detection mechanism
a new ontology evolution approach that combines a changes
a new ontology evolution approach is based on keeping track of the different versions of ontology concepts throughout track of the different versions of ontology concepts lifetime  called virtual versions 
a an automatic change detection mechanism approach is based on keeping track of the different versions of ontology concepts throughout track of the different versions of ontology concepts lifetime  called virtual versions 
in this way changes can be defined in terms of these virtual versionsontoclean is a unique approach towards the formal evaluation of ontologies as ontologies analyses the intensional content of concepts
although ontologies is well documented in numerous publications ontologies is still used rather infrequently due to the high costs for applying ontoclean especially on tagging concepts with the correct metaproperties
although ontologies importance is widely acknowledged ontologies is still used rather infrequently due to the high costs for applying ontoclean especially on tagging concepts with the correct metaproperties
in order to facilitate the use of ontoclean we provide aeon a tool which automatically tags concepts with appropriate ontoclean metaproperties
in order to enable proper evaluation of the use of ontoclean in realworld cases we provide aeon a tool which automatically tags concepts with appropriate ontoclean metaproperties
the implementation can be easily expanded to check the concepts for other abstract metaproperties thus providing for the first time tool support in order to enable intensional ontology evaluation for concepts
patterns indicating concepts metaproperties
we main idea is using the web as an embodiment of objective world knowledge where we search for patterns
we get an automatic tagging of the ontology thus reducing costs tremendously
moreover aeon lowers the risk of having subjective taggings
as part of the evaluation we report we experiences from creating a middlesized ontocleantagged reference ontologyin many web service composition problems information may be needed from web services during the composition process
existing research on web service composition  wsc  procedures has generally assumed that this information will not change
we describe two ways to modify two ways to deal with volatile information
we describe two ways to take such wsc proceduresmany alignment strategies have been proposed to facilitate the alignment task by semiautomatic means
ontology alignment is a prerequisite in order to allow for interoperation between different ontologies
due to the complexity of the alignment task manually defined methods for semiautomatic alignment rarely constitute an optimal configuration of substrategies from which substrategies have been built
in fact scrutinizing current ontology alignment methods one may recognize that most are not optimized for given ontologies
some few include machine learning for automating the task
some few optimization by machine learning means is mostly restricted to the extensional definition of ontology concepts
approach that explores the user validation of initial alignments for optimizing alignment methods
a machine learning approach
with apfel  alignment process feature estimation and learning  we present a machine
optimizing alignment methods are based on extensional ontology definitions
optimizing alignment methods are based on intensional ontology definitions
core to apfel is the idea of a generic alignment process the steps of which may be represented explicitly
apfel then generates new hypotheses for what might be useful features them by machine learning approaches
apfel then generates new hypotheses for what might be similarity assessments and weights them by machine learning approaches
apfel compares favorably in our experiments to competing approachesmost existing ontology mapping tools
most are inexact
the applications that use inexact ontology mapping rules if not rectified
inexact ontology mapping rules if not rectified result in imprecision in the applications
existing ontology mappings using a bayesian network
we describe a framework to probabilistically improve existing ontology mappings

furthermore we benchmark two common approaches for evaluating taxonomic queries either explicit noisa hybrid   matview not id 
furthermore we benchmark two common approaches for evaluating taxonomic queries either onthefly   matview not id 
furthermore we benchmark two common approaches by precomputing the transitive closure of subsumption relationships  matview not id 
the main conclusion drawn from we experiments
the main conclusion is that the evaluation of taxonomic queries is most efficient over rdfs stores utilizing the hybrid representations
the main conclusion is that the evaluation of taxonomic queries is most efficient over rdfs stores utilizing the matview representations
of the rest explicit noisa  exhibit overall better performance than not which is superior to that of id
id which exhibits the overall worst performance
of the rest schemaaware representations  exhibit overall better performance than not which is superior to that of id
