Often the challenge of finding relevant information is reduced to find the  right  people
In this paper our present innovative algorithms called Interestbased Node Grouping Algorithms  to boost performance
Interestbased Node Grouping Algorithms  which integrate personal routing indices into semantic query processing
In this paper our present innovative algorithms called INGA  to boost performance
INGA  which integrate personal routing indices into semantic query processing
semantically well chosen information
Similar to social networks peers in INGA cooperate to efficiently route queries for documents along adaptive shortcutbased overlays using only local
We propose active shortcut creation strategies for index building
a novel algorithm to select the most promising content providers depending on each peer index with respect to the individual query
We propose passive shortcut creation strategies for index building
We quantify the benefit of We indexing strategy by extensive performance experiments in the SWAP simulation infrastructure
While obtaining high recall values compared to other stateoftheart algorithms We show that INGA improves recall
While obtaining high recall values compared to other stateoftheart algorithms We show that INGA reduces the number of messages significantly
