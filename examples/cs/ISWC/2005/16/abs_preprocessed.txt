The paper reports on the development of the formal framework to design strategies for multiissue nonsymmetric meaning negotiations among software agents in a distributed information retrieval system
The advancements of the formal framework are the following
A resulting strategy compares the contexts of two background domain theories not concept by concept but the whole context to the other context by accounting the relationships among the available instances
A resulting strategy compares the contexts of two background domain theories not concept by concept but the whole context to the other context by accounting the relationships among concepts
A resulting strategy compares the contexts of two background domain theories not concept by concept but the whole context to the other context by accounting the relationships among the constraints over properties

A resulting strategy contains the mechanisms for to provide argumentation through generating extra contexts
A resulting strategy contains the mechanisms for measuring contextual similarity through assessing propositional substitutions
A resulting strategy uses presuppositions for choosing to make the mutual concession to the common sense monotonic
A resulting strategy uses presuppositions for choosing the best similarity hypotheses
A resulting strategy provides the means to evaluate the possible eagerness to concede through related notions of knowledgeability of reputation
A resulting strategy provides the means to evaluate the possible eagerness to concede through semantic commitments
A resulting strategy provides the means to evaluate the possible eagerness to concede through related notions of degree of reputation
