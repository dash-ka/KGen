many alignment strategies have been proposed to facilitate the alignment task by semiautomatic means
ontology alignment is a prerequisite in order to allow for interoperation between different ontologies
due to the complexity of the alignment task manually defined methods for semiautomatic alignment rarely constitute an optimal configuration of substrategies from which substrategies have been built
in fact scrutinizing current ontology alignment methods one may recognize that most are not optimized for given ontologies
some few include machine learning for automating the task
some few optimization by machine learning means is mostly restricted to the extensional definition of ontology concepts
approach that explores the user validation of initial alignments for optimizing alignment methods
a machine learning approach
with apfel  alignment process feature estimation and learning  we present a machine
optimizing alignment methods are based on extensional ontology definitions
optimizing alignment methods are based on intensional ontology definitions
core to apfel is the idea of a generic alignment process the steps of which may be represented explicitly
apfel then generates new hypotheses for what might be useful features them by machine learning approaches
apfel then generates new hypotheses for what might be similarity assessments and weights them by machine learning approaches
apfel compares favorably in our experiments to competing approaches
