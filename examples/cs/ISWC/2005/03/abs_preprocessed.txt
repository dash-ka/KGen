to make the semantic web a reality such data needs to be interpreted with respect to ontologies
much data is published on the web in xml format satisfying schemas
interpretation is achieved through a semantic mapping between the xml schema
interpretation is achieved through a semantic mapping between the ontology
we present work on the heuristic construction of complex such semantic mappings
semantic mappings when given an initial set of simple correspondences from xml schema attributes to datatype properties in the ontology
to accomplish this we first offer a mapping formalism to capture the semantics of xml schemas
second we present we heuristic mapping construction algorithm
finally we show through an empirical study that considerable effort can be saved when constructing complex mappings by using we prototype tool
