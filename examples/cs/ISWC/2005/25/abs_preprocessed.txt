in this paper we investigate the  in  dependence among owl documents with respect to the logical consequence when owl documents with respect are combined in particular the inference of concept assertions about individuals
in this paper we investigate the  in  dependence among owl documents with respect to the logical consequence when owl documents with respect are combined in particular the inference of role assertions about individuals
those documents that affect the inference of a given fact
on the one hand we present a systematic approach to identifying those documents
on the other hand we consider ways for fast detection of independence
several special cases in which two documents are independent of each other
first we demonstrate several special cases
secondly we introduce an algorithm for checking the independence in the general case
two applications in which the above results have allowed we to develop novel approaches to overcome some difficulties in reasoning with large scale owl data
in addition we describe two applications
two applications demonstrate the usefulness of this work for improving the scalability of a practical semantic web system
