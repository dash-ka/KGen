matching hierarchical structures like taxonomies is the premise for enabling interoperability among heterogenous data organizations
matching hierarchical structures like web directories is the premise for enabling interoperability among heterogenous data organizations
while the number of new matching solutions is increasing the evaluation issue is still open
this work addresses the problem of comparison for pairwise matching solutions
a methodology is proposed to overcome the issue of scalability
a large scale dataset is developed based on real world case study namely the web directories of looksmart
a large scale dataset is developed based on real world case study namely the web directories of google
a large scale dataset is developed based on real world case study namely the web directories of yahoo
finally an empirical evaluation is performed which compares the most representative solutions for taxonomy matching
we argue that a large scale dataset can play a key role in supporting the empirical analysis for the research effort in the area of taxonomy matching
