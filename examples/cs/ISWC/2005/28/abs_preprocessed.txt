We propose a new technique for approximate ABox reasoning with OWL DL ontologies
Essentially We obtain substantially improved reasoning performance by disregarding nonHorn features of OWL DL
We approach comes as a sideproduct of recent research rests on the idea of performing standard resolution over disjunctive rules by treating disjunctive rules as if disjunctive rules were nondisjunctive ones
We approach comes as a sideproduct of recent research results concerning a new transformation of OWL DL ontologies into negationfree disjunctive datalog 1 2 3 4
We analyse We reasoning approach by means of nonmonotonic reasoning techniques
an implementation called Screech
We present an implementation
