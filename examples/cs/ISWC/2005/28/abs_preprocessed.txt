we propose a new technique for approximate abox reasoning with owl dl ontologies
essentially we obtain substantially improved reasoning performance by disregarding nonhorn features of owl dl
we approach comes as a sideproduct of recent research results concerning a new transformation of owl dl ontologies into negationfree disjunctive datalog 1 2 3 4
we approach comes as a sideproduct of recent research rests on the idea of performing standard resolution over disjunctive rules by treating disjunctive rules as if disjunctive rules were nondisjunctive ones
we analyse we reasoning approach by means of nonmonotonic reasoning techniques
an implementation called screech
we present an implementation
