A common practice in conceptual modeling is to separate the intensional from the extensional model
Although very intuitive this approach is inadequate for many complex domains
many complex domains where the borderline between the two models is not clearcut
Therefore the most expressive of the Semantic Web ontology languages allows combining the extensional model by a feature we refer to as metamodeling
Therefore the most expressive of the Semantic Web ontology languages allows combining the intensional by a feature we refer to as metamodeling
Therefore OWLFull  allows combining the intensional by a feature we refer to as metamodeling
Therefore OWLFull  allows combining the extensional model by a feature we refer to as metamodeling
In this paper we show that the semantics of metamodeling adopted in OWLFull leads to undecidability of basic inference problems due to free mixing of logical symbols
In this paper we show that the semantics of metamodeling adopted in OWLFull leads to undecidability of basic inference problems due to free mixing of metalogical symbols
Based on this result we propose two alternative semantics for metamodeling the HiLog semantics
Based on this result we propose two alternative semantics for metamodeling the contextual
semantics is decidable
a description logic underlying OWLDL
we show that SHOIQ a description logic  extended with metamodeling under
Finally we show how the latter semantics can be used in practice to axiomatize the logical interaction between concepts
