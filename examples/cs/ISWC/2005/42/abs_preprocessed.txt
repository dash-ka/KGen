Domain ontologies very rarely model verbs as relations
Domain ontologies very rarely model verbs as relations holding between concepts
However the role of the verb as a central is undeniable
a central connecting element between concepts
Verbs specify the interaction between the participants of some action or event by expressing relations between Verbs
two classes that specify range
In parallel it can be argued from an ontology engineering point of view that verbs express a relation between two classes
two classes that specify domain
The work described here
The work is concerned with relation extraction for ontology extension along these lines
We describe a system
a system that is capable of automatically identifying pairs of concepts connected by a relation  over concepts from an existing ontology
a system that is capable of automatically identifying highly relevant triples  over concepts from an existing ontology
a system works by extracting a system grammatical arguments  from computing corresponding relations through a combination of statistical processing
