domain ontologies very rarely model verbs as relations holding between concepts
domain ontologies very rarely model verbs as relations
however the role of the verb as a central is undeniable
a central connecting element between concepts
verbs specify the interaction between the participants of some action or event by expressing relations between verbs
two classes that specify range
two classes that specify domain
in parallel it can be argued from an ontology engineering point of view that verbs express a relation between two classes
the work is concerned with relation extraction for ontology extension along these lines
the work described here
a system that is capable of automatically identifying highly relevant triples  over concepts from an existing ontology
we describe a system
a system that is capable of automatically identifying pairs of concepts connected by a relation  over concepts from an existing ontology
a system works by extracting relevant verbs grammatical arguments  from computing corresponding relations through a combination of linguistic processing

the fifa world cup that will be hosted in germany in 2006
a system has been developed in the context of the smartweb project
the smartweb project which aims at providing intelligent information services via mobile broadband devices on the fifa world cup
such services include question answering in the football domain
location based navigational information
