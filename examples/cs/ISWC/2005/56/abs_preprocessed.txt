many distributed services maintained by different organisations
escience experiments typically involve many distributed services
after an experiment has been executed it is useful for a scientist to verify that the execution is compatible with standards
after an experiment has been executed it is useful for a scientist to verify that the execution is compatible with some existing experimental criteria
after an experiment has been executed it is useful for a scientist to verify that the execution was performed correctly
scientists may also want to verify experiments
experiments performed by scientists colleagues
scientists may also want to review experiments
there are no exsiting frameworks for validating such experiments in todays escience systems
users therefore have to adopt other ad hoc methods
error checking performed by the services
users therefore have to rely on error checking
this paper introduces a platformindependent framework for validating workflow executions
services advertised in a registry
this paper relies on reasoning over semantic descriptions of services
this paper relies on reasoning over the documented provenance of experiment results
this validation process ensures thus results generated are meaningful
this validation process ensures experiments are performed correctly
a bioinformatics application that performs protein compressibility analysis
the framework is tested in a bioinformatics application
