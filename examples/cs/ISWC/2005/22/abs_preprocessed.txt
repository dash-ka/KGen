all these algorithms have been quite successfully employed in a variety of scenarios from filtering applications to recommendations of books at amazoncom
all these algorithms have been quite successfully employed in a variety of scenarios from filtering applications to recommendations of movies at amazoncom
however all these algorithms do not consider any more complex recommendation structures
however all these algorithms focus on single item recommendations
semantically rich complex recommendation structures represented as rdf graphs
this paper explores how semantically rich complex recommendation structures can be exchanged in a distributed social network
this paper explores how semantically rich complex recommendation structures can be shared in a distributed social network
after presenting a motivating scenario we define several annotation ontologies we use in order to describe context information on the users desktop
after presenting a motivating scenario we define several annotation ontologies we use in order to show how our ranking algorithm can exploit this information
we discuss how social distributed networks are specified using extended foaf vocabulary
we discuss how members of these interest groups share semantically rich recommendations in such a network
we discuss how these interest groups are specified using extended foaf vocabulary
semantically rich recommendations in such a network shared context described in annotation ontologies
semantically rich recommendations in such a network shared ranking information described in annotation ontologies
we propose an algorithm to show how rankings are influenced by the reputation of the members of the social network with whom the context is exchanged
these rankings which exploits available context information
we propose an algorithm to show how rankings are influenced by the context
the context received from other users
we propose an algorithm to compute these rankings
