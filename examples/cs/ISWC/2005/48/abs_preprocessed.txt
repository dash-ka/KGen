furthermore we benchmark two common approaches for evaluating taxonomic queries either explicit noisa hybrid   matview not id 
furthermore we benchmark two common approaches for evaluating taxonomic queries either onthefly   matview not id 
furthermore we benchmark two common approaches by precomputing the transitive closure of subsumption relationships  matview not id 
the main conclusion drawn from we experiments
the main conclusion is that the evaluation of taxonomic queries is most efficient over rdfs stores utilizing the hybrid representations
the main conclusion is that the evaluation of taxonomic queries is most efficient over rdfs stores utilizing the matview representations
of the rest explicit noisa  exhibit overall better performance than not which is superior to that of id
id which exhibits the overall worst performance
of the rest schemaaware representations  exhibit overall better performance than not which is superior to that of id
