the techniques used during ontology lifecycle
design patterns that improve the techniques
design patterns that facilitate the techniques
The paper presents a framework for introducing design patterns
Some distinctions are drawn between kinds of ontology design patterns
Some contentoriented patterns are presented in order to illustrate Some contentoriented patterns utility at different degrees of abstraction
Some contentoriented patterns are presented how Some contentoriented patterns can be specialized
Some contentoriented patterns are presented how Some contentoriented patterns can be composed
The proposed framework are designed in order to function as a pipeline
a pipeline connecting user requirements to be executed
the initial set of patterns are designed in order to function as a pipeline
a pipeline connecting ontologydriven tasksqueries to be executed
a pipeline connecting domain modelling to be executed
