we propose a declarative update language for rdf graphs
our language called rul
our language ensures that the execution of the update primitives on arcs
our language ensures that the execution of the update primitives on nodes
our language ensures that the execution of the violates the semantics of the rdf model
our language ensures that the execution of the violates the semantics of the given rdfs schema
in addition rul takes benefit of the full expressive power of rql for restricting the range of variables to nodes of rdf graphs

in addition rul supports finegrained updates at property instance level setoriented updates with a deterministic semantics
