RDF graphs which is based on the paradigms of RVL
RDF graphs which is based on the paradigms of view languages RQL
We propose a declarative update language for RDF graphs
RDF graphs which is based on the paradigms of query languages RQL
Our language ensures that the execution of the update primitives on arcs
Our language ensures that the execution of the update primitives on nodes
Our language ensures that the execution of the violates the semantics of the RDF model
Our language ensures that the execution of the violates the semantics of the given RDFS schema
Our language called RUL
In addition RUL takes benefit of the full expressive power of RQL for restricting the range of variables to nodes of RDF graphs
In addition RUL supports finegrained updates at the class setoriented updates with a deterministic semantics
