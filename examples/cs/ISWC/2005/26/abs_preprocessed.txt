one of the major problems of large scale distributed is the potential introduction of inconsistencies
evolving ontologies is the potential introduction of inconsistencies
in this paper we survey four different approaches to handling inconsistency in dlbased ontologies  repairing inconsistencies reasoning in the presence of inconsistencies
in this paper we survey four different approaches to handling inconsistency in dlbased ontologies  repairing inconsistencies reasoning in the presence of multiversion reasoning
in this paper we survey four different approaches to handling consistent ontology evolution repairing inconsistencies reasoning in the presence of inconsistencies
in this paper we survey four different approaches to handling consistent ontology evolution repairing inconsistencies reasoning in the presence of multiversion reasoning
we present a common formal basis for all of them
we use this common basis to compare these approaches
we discuss the knowledge requirements of the various methods
the conditions under which each of these methods is applicable
we discuss the different requirements for each of these methods
we discuss the conditions
we discuss the different usage scenarios to which these methods would apply
