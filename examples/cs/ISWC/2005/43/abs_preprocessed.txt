semantic query optimization has been extensively studied for relational
semantic query optimization has been extensively studied for object
semantic query optimization has been extensively studied for deductive
semantic query optimization has been extensively studied for xml databases
semantic query optimization has been proved to be quite useful in various applications 
semantic query optimization has been proved to be eg data integration graphical query generators caching 
however less attention to semantic query optimization has been devoted in the context of the semantic web
in this paper we present sound algorithms for the containment and minimization of rdfs query patterns
in this paper we present complete algorithms for the containment and minimization of rdfs query patterns
more precisely we consider two widely used rdfs query fragments but also at the schema level
rdfs query fragments supporting pattern matching at the data
we advocate a logic framework for capturing the rdfs data model
to this end
wellestablished techniques proposed in the relational context in the backchase algorithms
we employ wellestablished techniques
wellestablished techniques proposed in the relational context in particular
we advocate a logic framework for capturing semantics
wellestablished techniques proposed in the relational context in the chase algorithms
