specialised agents that provides efficient gathering from diverse resources
This paper presents serse SEmantic Routing SystEm a distributed multiagent system
specialised agents that provides aggregation of digital content from diverse resources
a distributed multiagent system composed of specialised agents
specialised agents that provides robust gathering from diverse resources
The agents composing serse use ontological descriptions to search semantically annotated knowledge sources by maintaining a semantic index of the instances of the annotation ontology
The agents
The agents composing serse use ontological descriptions to retrieve semantically annotated knowledge sources by maintaining a semantic index of the instances of the annotation ontology
The efficient retrieval is made The efficient retrieval possible through the semantic routing mechanism by reducing the number of messages
the semantic routing mechanism that permits to identify the agent indexing the resources requested by a user query
The efficient retrieval is made The efficient retrieval possible through the semantic routing mechanism without having to maintain a central index
messages broadcasted to the system
the system is also capable of exhibiting autonomic behaviour
Autonomic behaviour is characterised by self configuration aimed at permitting the system to manage the failure of one of its agents
Autonomic behaviour is characterised by self configuration aimed at permitting the system to ensure continuous functioning
Autonomic behaviour is characterised by self healing capabilities aimed at permitting the system to ensure continuous functioning
Autonomic behaviour is characterised by self healing capabilities aimed at permitting the system to manage the failure of one of its agents
