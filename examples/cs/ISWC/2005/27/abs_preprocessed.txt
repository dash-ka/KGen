a framework based on logic programming
we introduce a framework for preferential reasoning with agents on the semantic web
a logic program equipped with call literals
initially we encode the knowledge of an agent as a logic program
such call literals enable an agent to pose yesno queries to arbitrary knowledge sources on the semantic web without the representation language of those sources
such call literals enable an agent to pose yesno queries to arbitrary knowledge sources on the semantic web without conditions on
the extended answer set semantics
as those conflicts may arise from reasoning with different knowledge sources we use the extended answer
semantics which can provide different strategies for solving those conflicts
allowing in addition for an agent to express its preference for the satisfaction of certain rules over others we can then induce a preference order on those strategies
however since it is natural for an agent to believe it own knowledge  encoded in the program  it can alternatively express preferences on call literals
however since it consider some sources more reliable than others it can alternatively express preferences on call literals
finally we show how an agent can learn preferences on call literals if an agent is part of a web of trusted agents
