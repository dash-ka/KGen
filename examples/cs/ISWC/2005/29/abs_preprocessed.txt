multiversion ontology in which a temporal logic is developed to serve as this paper semantic foundation
in this paper we propose a framework for reasoning with multiversion ontology
we show that the temporal logic approach can provide a solid semantic foundation
a solid semantic foundation which can support various requirements on multiversion ontology reasoning
we have implemented the prototype of more 
we have implemented the prototype of multiversion ontology reasoner 
multiversion ontology reasoner  which is based on the proposed framework
more  which is based on the proposed framework
we have tested more with several realistic ontologies
in this paper we report the experiments with more
in this paper we also discuss the implementation issues
