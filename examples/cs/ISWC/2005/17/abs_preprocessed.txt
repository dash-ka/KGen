This problem has been extensively studied in the field of belief change being the AGM theory
This problem has been extensively studied in the field of the dominating approach being the AGM theory
logics used in the Semantic Web
the AGM theory set the standard for determining the rationality of a given belief change mechanism
the AGM theory was placed in a certain context such as OWL
the AGM theory was placed in a certain context such as Description Logics
a certain context which makes the AGM theory inapplicable to logics
We believe the Semantic Web community would benefit from the application of the AGM theory AGM to such logics
the Semantic Web community is a preliminary study towards the feasibility of the application of the AGM theory
Our approach has an important practical impact too
Our approach raises interesting theoretical challenges
an important practical impact too given the central role that Description Logics in the Semantic Web
