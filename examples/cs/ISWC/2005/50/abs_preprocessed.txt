ontoclean is a unique approach towards the formal evaluation of ontologies as ontologies analyses the intensional content of concepts
although ontologies is well documented in numerous publications ontologies is still used rather infrequently due to the high costs for applying ontoclean especially on tagging concepts with the correct metaproperties
although ontologies importance is widely acknowledged ontologies is still used rather infrequently due to the high costs for applying ontoclean especially on tagging concepts with the correct metaproperties
in order to facilitate the use of ontoclean we provide aeon a tool which automatically tags concepts with appropriate ontoclean metaproperties
in order to enable proper evaluation of the use of ontoclean in realworld cases we provide aeon a tool which automatically tags concepts with appropriate ontoclean metaproperties
the implementation can be easily expanded to check the concepts for other abstract metaproperties thus providing for the first time tool support in order to enable intensional ontology evaluation for concepts
patterns indicating concepts metaproperties
we main idea is using the web as an embodiment of objective world knowledge where we search for patterns
we get an automatic tagging of the ontology thus reducing costs tremendously
moreover aeon lowers the risk of having subjective taggings
as part of the evaluation we report we experiences from creating a middlesized ontocleantagged reference ontology
