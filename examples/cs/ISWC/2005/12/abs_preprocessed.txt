decentralized casebased reasoning is a reasoning framework
a reasoning framework that addresses the problem of adaptive reasoning in a multiontology environment
a casebased reasoning  cbr  approach which relies on contextualized ontologies in the cowl formalism for the representation of adaptation knowledge
a casebased reasoning  cbr  approach which relies on contextualized ontologies in the cowl formalism for the representation of domain knowledge
it is a casebased reasoning  cbr  approach
a context in cowl is used to represent a particular viewpoint containing the knowledge
the knowledge needed to solve a particular local problem
semantic relations between contexts allow the cbr process in a particular viewpoint to reuse information about the problem
semantic relations between contexts allow the cbr process in a particular viewpoint to reuse information about the already found solutions in the other viewpoints
semantic relations between the associated reasoning mechanisms allow the cbr process in a particular viewpoint to reuse information about the problem
semantic relations between the associated reasoning mechanisms allow the cbr process in a particular viewpoint to share information about the problem
semantic relations between the associated reasoning mechanisms allow the cbr process in a particular viewpoint to share information about the already found solutions in the other viewpoints
