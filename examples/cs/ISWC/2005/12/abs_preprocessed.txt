a reasoning framework that addresses the problem of adaptive reasoning in a multiontology environment
Decentralized casebased reasoning is a reasoning framework
a casebased reasoning  CBR  approach which relies on contextualized ontologies in the COWL formalism for the representation of domain knowledge
a casebased reasoning  CBR  approach which relies on contextualized ontologies in the COWL formalism for the representation of adaptation knowledge
It is a casebased reasoning  CBR  approach
A context in COWL is used to represent a particular viewpoint containing the knowledge
the knowledge needed to solve a particular local problem
Semantic relations between contexts allow the CBR process in a particular viewpoint to share information about the already found solutions in the other viewpoints
Semantic relations between the associated reasoning mechanisms allow the CBR process in a particular viewpoint to reuse information about the problem
