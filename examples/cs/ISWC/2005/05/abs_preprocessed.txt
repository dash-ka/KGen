In this paper we apply automatic tools to the verification of interaction protocols of Web services
Web services described in OWLS
Specifically we propose a modeling procedure
a modeling procedure that preserves the control flow Process Models
a modeling procedure that preserves the data flow of OWLS Process Models
The result of we work provides complete modeling and verification of OWLS Process Models
