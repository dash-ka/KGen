web services described in owls
in this paper we apply automatic tools to the verification of interaction protocols of web services
specifically we propose a modeling procedure
a modeling procedure that preserves the data flow of owls process models
a modeling procedure that preserves the control flow process models
the result of we work provides complete modeling and verification of owls process models
