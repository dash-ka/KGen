In many practical applications ontologies tend to be very large and complicated
In order for users to quickly understand largescale ontologies in this paper we propose a novel ontology visualization approach
In order for users to quickly analyze largescale ontologies in this paper we propose a novel ontology visualization approach
a novel ontology visualization approach which aims to complement existing approaches like the hierarchy graph
Specifically we approach produces a holistic  imaging  of the ontology
the ontology which contains a semantic layout of the ontology classes
In addition the distributions of instance relations are also depicted in the  imaging 
In addition the distributions of the ontology instances are also depicted in the  imaging 
the key techniques and algorithms used in we approach
we introduce at length the key techniques and algorithms
Then we examine the resulting user interface and find the resulting user interface facilitates tasks like ontology retrieval
Then we examine the resulting user interface and find the resulting user interface facilitates tasks like ontology instance analysis
Then we examine the resulting user interface and find the resulting user interface facilitates tasks like ontology navigation
