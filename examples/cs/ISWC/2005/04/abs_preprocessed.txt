automated reasoning are the building blocks of the Semantic Web initiative
Ontologies are the building blocks of the Semantic Web initiative
Derivation rules can be included in an ontology to define derived concepts based on base concepts
a class or property based on a complex relation between the extensions of the same classes and properties
For example rules allow to define the extension of a class or property
a class or property based on a complex relation between the extensions of the other classes and properties
On the other hand the inclusion in the form of explicit negative information is also needed to enable various forms of reasoning
On the other hand the inclusion in the form of negationasfailure is also needed to enable various forms of reasoning
On the other hand the inclusion of negative information is also needed to enable various forms of reasoning
In this paper we extend derivation rules
In this paper we extend RDF graphs with strong negation
In this paper we extend RDF graphs with weak negation
The ERDF stable model semantics of the extended framework is defined extending RDF semantics
A distinctive feature of our theory is that both falsity extensions of properties are considered allowing for truth value gaps

Our framework supports both openworld reasoning through the ERDF ontological categories of total properties
Our framework supports both openworld reasoning through the ERDF ontological categories of total classes
Our framework supports both closedworld reasoning through the ERDF ontological categories of total properties
Our framework supports both closedworld reasoning through the ERDF ontological categories of total classes
Our framework supports both closedworld reasoning through the explicit representation of the particular closedworld assumptions
