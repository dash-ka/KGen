we present a method for rapid development of benchmarks for the semantic web knowledge base systems
at the core we have a synthetic data generation approach for models the real world data
at the core we have a synthetic data generation approach for owl
owl that is scalable
the datageneration algorithm generates benchmark data based on the extracted properties relevant for benchmarking
the datageneration algorithm learns from real domain documents
we believe that this is important because relative performance of systems will vary depending on data
we believe that this is important because relative performance of systems will vary depending on the structure of the ontology
data used
however due to the novelty of the semantic web we rarely have sufficient data for benchmarking
we approach allows we to develop benchmarks for a variety of domains in a very time efficient manner
we approach allows we to develop benchmarks for a variety of applications in a very time efficient manner
we approach helps overcome the problem of having insufficient real world data for benchmarking
based on we method we have created a new lehigh bibtex benchmark and conducted an experiment on four semantic web knowledge base systems
we have verified we hypothesis about the need for representative data by comparing the experimental result to that of we previous lehigh university benchmark
the difference in both performance of thus the need of using a representative benchmark for the intended application of the systems
the difference in both experiments has demonstrated the influence of ontology on the capability of thus the need of using a representative benchmark for the intended application of the systems
