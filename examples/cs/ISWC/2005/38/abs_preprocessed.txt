Most are inexact
Most existing ontology mapping tools
Inexact ontology mapping rules if not rectified result in imprecision in the applications
the applications that use Inexact ontology mapping rules if not rectified
We describe a framework to probabilistically improve existing ontology mappings
existing ontology mappings using a Bayesian Network
nodes that are neighbours to matched nodes in the two ontologies
Omen  is based on a set of metarules
an Ontology Mapping ENhancer is based on a set of metarules
metarules that captures the influence of the ontology structure to match nodes
metarules that captures the influence of the existing matches to match nodes
We have implemented a protype ontology matcher
a protype ontology matcher that can either enhance existing matches between ontology concepts
a protype ontology matcher that can either map concepts across two input ontologies
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that Omen enhances existing ontology mappings in our test cases
