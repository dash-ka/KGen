most existing ontology mapping tools
most are inexact
the applications that use inexact ontology mapping rules if not rectified
inexact ontology mapping rules if not rectified result in imprecision in the applications
existing ontology mappings using a bayesian network
we describe a framework to probabilistically improve existing ontology mappings
nodes that are neighbours to matched nodes in the two ontologies
metarules that captures the influence of the existing matches to match nodes
an ontology mapping enhancer is based on a set of metarules
omen  is based on a set of metarules
metarules that captures the influence of the ontology structure to match nodes
a protype ontology matcher that can either map concepts across two input ontologies
we have implemented a protype ontology matcher
a protype ontology matcher that can either enhance existing matches between ontology concepts
preliminary experiments demonstrate that omen enhances existing ontology mappings in our test cases
