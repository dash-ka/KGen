the benchmarking methodology used to improve the performance
the benchmarking methodology used to improve the scalability of ontology development tools
In this paper we present briefly the benchmarking methodology
we focus on the definition of the infrastructure for evaluating the performance of Ontology tools performance
we focus on the definition of the infrastructure for evaluating scalability ontology management APIs in terms of Ontology tools performance
we focus on the definition of the infrastructure for evaluating scalability ontology management APIs in terms of scalability execution efficiency
we also present the results of applying the benchmarking methodology
the benchmarking methodology used to improve the scalability of ontology development tools for evaluating the API of the WebODE ontology engineering workbench
