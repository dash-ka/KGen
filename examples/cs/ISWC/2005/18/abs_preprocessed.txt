the effective debugging of ontologies is an important prerequisite for impact on the semantic web
the effective debugging of ontologies is an important prerequisite for ontologies successful application
the heart of this debugging process is the diagnosis of faulty knowledge bases
in this paper we define general concepts for the diagnosis of ontologies
based on general concepts we provide correct algorithms for the computation of minimal diagnoses of knowledge bases
based on general concepts we provide complete algorithms for the computation of minimal diagnoses of knowledge bases
general concepts are broadly applicable since general concepts are independent of a particular variant of an underlying logic  with monotonic semantics 
general concepts are broadly applicable since general concepts are independent of a particular variant of independent of a particular reasoning system
the practical feasibility of our method is shown by extensive test evaluations
