we introduce an experience in building a public semantic web server
a public semantic web server maintaining annotations about the actors of a telecom valley
inference used in building one type of cartography of the competences of the economic actors of a telecom valley
we then focus on an example of inference
we detailed how this inference exploits the graph model of the semantic web
the semantic web using conceptual clustering
the semantic web using ontologybased metrics
we give the associated interpretations
we prove the characteristics of theses metrics and inferences
