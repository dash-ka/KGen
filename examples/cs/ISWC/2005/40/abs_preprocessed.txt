automatic ontology mapping based on bayesowl our developed for modeling uncertainty in semantic web
automatic ontology mapping based on a probabilistic framework our developed for modeling uncertainty in semantic web
this paper presents our ongoing effort on developing a principled methodology for automatic ontology mapping
the two translated bns
in this approach the source ontologies are first translated into bayesian networks the concept mapping between the two ontologies are treated as evidential reasoning between the two
in this approach the target ontologies are first translated into bayesian networks the concept mapping between the two ontologies are treated as evidential reasoning between the two
probabilities are learned using text classification techniques guided web mining
text classification techniques where each concept in an ontology is associated with a set of semantically relevant text documents
probabilities needed for measuring semantic similarity during mapping
semantically relevant text documents which are obtained by ontology
probabilities needed for constructing conditional probability tables during translation
the basic ideas of this approach are validated by positive results from computer experiments on two small realworld ontologies
