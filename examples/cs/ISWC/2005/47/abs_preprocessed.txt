this paper extends the model theory of rdf with rules placing an emphasis on integration with decidability of entailment
this paper extends the model theory of rdf with rules placing an emphasis on integration with owl of entailment
rule graphs which generalize rdf graphs by also allowing rule variables in object positions
rule graphs which generalize rdf graphs by also allowing rule variables in predicate positions
an abstract syntax that views a rule as a pair of rule graphs
rule graphs which generalize rdf graphs by also allowing rule variables in subject positions
we start from an abstract syntax
owl that weakens dentailment
we include rdfs
we include a decidable part of owl
owl that weakens owl full
classes can be used as instances
almost all examples in the daml set of test rules are covered by we approach
