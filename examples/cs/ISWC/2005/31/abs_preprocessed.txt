in this paper we present the design and implementation of brahms an efficient rdf storage system specifically designed to support fast semantic association discovery in large rdf bases
we present timing results of several tests performed with brahms specifically designed to support fast semantic association discovery in large rdf bases to similar tests three of the wellknown rdf storage systems
we present memory usage of several tests performed with brahms specifically designed to support fast semantic association discovery in large rdf bases to similar tests three of the wellknown rdf storage systems
similar tests performed using sesame
similar tests performed using redland
we present memory usage of several tests compare an efficient rdf storage system specifically designed to support fast semantic association discovery in large rdf bases to similar tests three of the wellknown rdf storage systems
similar tests performed using jena

we results show that brahms handles basic association discovery well while even the lowlevel apis in the other three tested systems are not suitable for the implementation of semantic association discovery algorithms
