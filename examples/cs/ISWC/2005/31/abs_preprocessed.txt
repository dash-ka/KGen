Discovery of semantic associations in Semantic Web ontologies is an important task in various analytical activities

In this paper we present the design and implementation of BRAHMS an efficient RDF storage system specifically designed to support fast semantic association discovery in large RDF bases
We present timing results of several tests compare an efficient RDF storage system specifically designed to support fast semantic association discovery in large RDF bases to similar tests three of the wellknown RDF storage systems
similar tests performed using Sesame
We present memory usage of several tests compare BRAHMS specifically designed to support fast semantic association discovery in large RDF bases to similar tests three of the wellknown RDF storage systems
similar tests performed using Redland
We present memory usage of several tests performed with BRAHMS specifically designed to support fast semantic association discovery in large RDF bases to similar tests three of the wellknown RDF storage systems

We present timing results of several tests performed with BRAHMS specifically designed to support fast semantic association discovery in large RDF bases to similar tests three of the wellknown RDF storage systems
We results show that BRAHMS handles basic association discovery well while the RDF query languages are not suitable for the implementation of semantic association discovery algorithms
We results show that BRAHMS handles basic association discovery well while even the lowlevel APIs in the other three tested systems are not suitable for the implementation of semantic association discovery algorithms
