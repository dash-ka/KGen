one of the main goals of the semantic web services effort is to enable automated composition of web services
an endtoend view of the service composition process involves development of executable workflows
an endtoend view of the service composition process involves deployment on an execution environment
an endtoend view of the service composition process involves automation of composite service creation
however the main focus in literature has been on the initial part of formally representing web service capabilities and reasoning about the main focus in literature composition
the main focus in literature composition using ai techniques
based upon our experience in building an endtoend composition tool for application integration our bring out issues
issues that have an impact on information modeling aspects of the composition process
in this paper we present approaches for solving problems relating to scalability of service descriptions and data flow construction for operationalizing the composed services
in this paper we present approaches for solving problems relating to manageability of service descriptions and data flow construction for operationalizing the composed services
