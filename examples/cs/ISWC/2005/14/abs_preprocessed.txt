in this paper we describe how we handle heterogeneity in web service interaction through a choreography mechanism that we have developed for irsiii
irsiii is a framework and platform for developing semantic web services
semantic web services which utilizes the wsmo ontology
the overall design of we choreography framework is based on which actor has the initiative
the overall design of we choreography framework is based on irsiii
the overall design of we choreography framework is based on which actor has a formal semantics
the initiative
the overall design of we choreography framework is based on the use of ontologies
representations which can be executed
irsiii playing the role of a broker differentiating between communication direction
the overall design of we choreography framework is based on the use of state
having representations
the overall design of we choreography framework is based on which actor has the ability to suspend communication
the overall design of we choreography framework is based on which actor has
we framework has a full implementation which we illustrate through an example application
