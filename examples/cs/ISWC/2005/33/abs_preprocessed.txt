recently there have been a number of proposals for languages for expressing web service constraints and capabilities with wspolicy
wspolicy leading the way
wspl leading the way
the proposed languages although relatively inexpressive suffer from a lack of formal semantics
in this paper we provide a mapping of wspolicy to the description logic fragment species of the web ontology language
in this paper we describe how standard the web ontology language reasoners can be used to check policy conformance
in this paper we describe how standard the web ontology language reasoners can be used to perform an array of policy analysis tasks
the web ontology language is much more expressive than wspolicy
the web ontology language thus provides a framework for exploring richer policy languages
