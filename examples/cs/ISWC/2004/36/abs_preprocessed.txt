To date the semantic indexing of images has concentrated on applying machinelearning techniques to a set of manuallyannotated images in order to automatically label images with keywords
RulesByExample which is based on a combination of QueryByExample
RulesByExample which is based on a combination of RuleML
In this paper we propose a new hybrid userassisted approach RulesByExample
we RulesByExample user interface enables domainexperts to graphically define domainspecific rules  eg color texture shape size of regions 
domainspecific rules that can infer highlevel semantic descriptions of images from combinations of lowlevel visual features
domainspecific rules  eg color texture shape size of regions  which have been specified through examples
domainspecific rules that can infer highlevel semantic descriptions of images from combinations of lowlevel visual features
domainspecific rules LRB eg color texture shape size of regions RRB which have been specified through examples
semantically meaningful labels using terms
Using domainspecific rules LRB eg color texture shape size of regions RRB the system is able to analyze the visual features of any given image from this domain
terms defined in the domainspecific ontology
Using domainspecific rules LRB eg color texture shape size of regions RRB the system is able to generate semantically meaningful labels
