we present a framework to facilitate automated synthesis of scientific experiment workflows in semantic grids
semantic grids based on highlevel goal specification
we framework has two main features
two main features which distinguish our framework from other work in this area
first we propose a adaptive mechanism for automating the construction of experiment workflows
first we propose a dynamic mechanism for automating the construction of experiment workflows
second we distinguish between different levels of abstraction of loosely coupled experiment workflows to facilitate reuse of experiments
second we distinguish between different levels of abstraction of loosely coupled experiment workflows to facilitate sharing of experiments
we illustrate our framework using a real world application scenario in the physics domain
the physics domain involving the detection of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources
