we show that the semantic web needs a formal semantics for the various kinds of links between ontologies
we show that the semantic web needs a formal semantics for the various kinds of links between other documents
we provide a model theoretic semantics
theoretic semantics that takes into account ontology extension
theoretic semantics that takes into ontology versioning
since the semantic web is the product of a diverse community as opposed to a single agent this semantics accommodates different viewpoints by having different entailment relations for different ontology perspectives
we discuss how this theory can be practically applied to owl
we discuss how this theory can provide a theorem
a theorem that shows how to compute perspectivebased entailment using existing logical reasoners
we discuss how this theory can be practically applied to rdf
we conclude with a discussion of future work
we illustrate these concepts using examples
