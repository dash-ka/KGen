this paper introduces a visual umlbased notation for owl ontologies
a standard mof2 compliant metamodel which captures the language primitives
the language primitives offered by owl dl
we provide a standard mof2 compliant metamodel
similarly we invent a uml profile
a uml profile which allows to visually model owl ontologies in a notation
a notation that is close to the uml notation
this allows to develop ontologies
ontologies using uml tools
throughout this paper the significant differences to some earlier proposals for a visual umlbased notation for ontologies are discussed
