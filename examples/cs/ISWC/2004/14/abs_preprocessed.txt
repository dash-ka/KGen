This paper introduces a visual UMLbased notation for OWL ontologies
the language primitives offered by OWL DL
a standard MOF2 compliant metamodel which captures the language primitives
We provide a standard MOF2 compliant metamodel
a notation that is close to the UML notation
a UML profile which allows to visually model OWL ontologies in a notation
Similarly We invent a UML profile
This allows to develop ontologies
ontologies using UML tools
Throughout This paper the significant differences to some earlier proposals for a visual UMLbased notation for ontologies are discussed
