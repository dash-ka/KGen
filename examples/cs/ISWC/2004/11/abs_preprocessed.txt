We argue that in a distributed context such as the Semantic Web ontology engineers and data creators often can not control  or even imagine  the possible uses creators ontologies might have
these might be of a different granularity than the initial scope of the ontology
Therefore ontologies are unlikely to identify every useful classification possible in a problem domain
for example these might be appropriate for a certain user in a certain context
for example these might be of a personalised nature
Therefore ontologies are unlikely to identify every interesting classification possible in a problem domain
We argue that machine learning techniques will be essential within the Semantic Web context to allow these unspecified classifications to be identified
In this paper We explore the application of machine learning methods to FOAF highlighting the challenges
the challenges posed by the characteristics of such data
Specifically we use clustering to identify classes of people to learn descriptions of these groups
Specifically we use clustering to identify classes of inductive logic programming to learn descriptions of these groups
reusable first class knowledge that is neither explicitly stated
We argue that These new descriptions constitute reusable first class knowledge
reusable first class knowledge that deducible from the input data
These new descriptions can be represented as more sophisticated descriptions using SWRL
These new descriptions can be represented as simple OWL class restrictions using SWRL
These are then suitable either for onthefly use for personalisation tasks
These are then suitable either for incorporation into future versions of ontologies
