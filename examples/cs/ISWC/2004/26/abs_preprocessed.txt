Different planning techniques have been applied to the problem of automated composition of web services
However in realistic cases this planning problem is far from trivial the planner needs to deal with with complex goals
However in realistic cases this planning problem is far from trivial the planner needs to deal with the partial observability of web services internal status
complex goals expressing temporal conditions
complex goals expressing preference requirements
However in realistic cases this planning problem is far from trivial the planner needs to deal with the nondeterministic behavior of web services
web services described in OWLS process models
OWLS process models which can deal effectively with complex goals
We propose a planning technique for the automated composition of web services
OWLS process models which can deal effectively with partial observability
OWLS process models which can deal effectively with nondeterminism
a planning technique for the automated composition of web services allows for the synthesis of plans
OWLS process models which can deal effectively with partial observability
plans that encode compositions of web services with the usual programming constructs like iterations
web services described in OWLS process models
OWLS process models which can deal effectively with nondeterminism
plans that encode compositions of web services with the usual programming constructs like conditionals
OWLS process models which can deal effectively with complex goals
The generated plans can thus be translated into executable processes
The generated plans can thus be translated into BPEL4WS programs
We do some preliminary experimental evaluations
some preliminary experimental evaluations that show the potentialities of We approach
We do the gain in performance of automating the composition at the semantic level wrt the automated composition at the level of executable processes
We implement We solution in a planner
