a central requirement for achieving the vision of runtime discovery is the provision of appropriate descriptions of the operation of a service
a service that is how a service interacts with other services
a service that is how a service interacts with agents
a central requirement for achieving dynamic composition of services is the provision of appropriate descriptions of the operation of a service
in this paper we use experience gained through the development of reallife grid applications to produce a set of those requirements to match those requirements against the offerings of existing work such as owls
in this paper we use experience gained through the development of reallife grid applications to produce a set of those requirements to match those requirements against the offerings of existing work such as irsii
based on this analysis we identify which requirements are not addressed by current research and in response produce a model for describing the interaction protocol of a service in response
interactions initiated by the service
the main contributions of a model are the ability to describe the interactions of multiple parties with respect to a single service distinguish between interactions the service
other cooperating services
parties that are either a result of internal service events or interactions
interactions that are initiated by clients
the main contributions of a model are the ability to describe the interactions of multiple parties with respect to a single service distinguish between interactions interactions or other and capture within the description service state changes relevant to interacting parties
to inform the further development of such work
the aim of a model is not to replace existing work since a model only focuses on the description of the interaction protocol of a service
