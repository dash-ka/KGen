OWL provides the owl imports construct which roughly allows Web ontologies to include other Web ontologies but only by merging all the linked ontologies into a single logical  space

These formalisms have various degrees of robustness in These formalisms intuitiveness to modelers
These formalisms have various degrees of robustness in These formalisms modularity These formalisms expressivity
These formalisms have various degrees of robustness in These formalisms computational complexity
In this paper we explore a family of such formalisms
a novel subformalism that seems very straightforward to implement on existing tableau OWL reasoners as witnessed by we implementation of this formalism in the OWL reasoner Pellet
such formalisms grounded in Econnections as extensions to OWL with emphasis on a novel subformalism
we discuss how to integrate These formalisms into some of the issues that modelers have to face when using such formalisms in the context of a large number of heterogeneous independently developed richly interconnected ontologies that we expect to be the norm on the Semantic Web
