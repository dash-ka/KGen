the standardization of owl leaves a crucial issue for webbased ontologies unsatisfactorily resolved how to represent
the standardization of owl leaves reason with multiple distinct
owl provides the owl imports construct which roughly allows web ontologies to include other web ontologies but only by merging all the linked ontologies into a single logical  space

a novel subformalism that seems very straightforward to implement on existing tableau owl reasoners as witnessed by we implementation of this formalism in the owl reasoner pellet
such formalisms grounded in econnections as extensions to owl with emphasis on a novel subformalism
in this paper we explore a family of such formalisms
we discuss how to integrate these formalisms into owl that we expect to be the norm on the semantic web
we discuss how to integrate these formalisms into some of the issues that modelers have to face when using such formalisms in the context of a large number of heterogeneous independently developed richly interconnected ontologies that we expect to be the norm on the semantic web
