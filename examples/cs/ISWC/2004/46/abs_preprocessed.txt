semiautomatic mapping of ontologies is a core task to achieve interoperability when two agents use different ontologies
semiautomatic mapping of ontologies is a core task to achieve interoperability when services use different ontologies
in the existing literature the focus has so far been on improving the quality of mapping results
we here consider qom quick ontology mapping as a way to trade off between effectiveness of the mapping generation algorithms
we here consider qom quick ontology mapping as a way to trade off between efficiency of the mapping generation algorithms
we show that qom has lower runtime complexity than existing prominent approaches
then we show in experiments that this theoretical investigation translates into practical benefits
while qom gives up some of the possibilities for producing highquality results in favor of efficiency we experiments show that this loss of quality is marginal
