a paper entitled small can be beautiful in knowledge representation in order to guarantee good computational properties
knowledge representation in which peter patelschneider advocated for limiting the expressive power of knowledge representation formalisms
in 1984 peter patelschneider published a paper
in 1984 peter patelschneider thus make knowledgebased systems usable as part of larger systems
in a paper we have to limit the expressive power of the ontologies
the ontologies serving as semantic marking up of resources
a paper entitled small can be beautiful in knowledge representation in order to guarantee good computational properties peter patelschneider aim at showing that the same argument holds for the future semantic web if we want to give a chance for the future semantic web to scale up
a paper entitled small can be beautiful in knowledge representation in order to guarantee good computational properties peter patelschneider aim at showing that the same argument holds for the future semantic web if we want to give a chance for the future semantic web to be broadly used
knowledge representation in which he advocated for limiting the expressive power of knowledge representation formalisms
in addition due to the scale of the future semantic web users it is unavoidable to have to deal with distributed heterogeneous ontologies
in addition due to the disparity of the future semantic web users it is unavoidable to have to deal with distributed heterogeneous ontologies
in a paper peter patelschneider will argue that a peertopeer infrastructure enriched with simple distributed ontologies  is appropriate and scalable for supporting the future semantic web
in a paper peter patelschneider will argue that a peertopeer infrastructure enriched with eg taxonomies  is appropriate and scalable for supporting the future semantic web

simple distributed ontologies  reconciled through mappings
