Increasing the number of peers in a peertopeer network usually increases the number of answers to a given query as well
While having more answers is nice in principle users are not interested in unordered answer sets answers
While having more answers is nice in principle users are not interested in arbitrarily large answer sets answers
While having more answers is nice in principle users are not interested in a small set of  best  answers
both answer set size traffic among peers
both answer set network traffic among peers
Inspired by the success of ranking algorithms in topk query evaluation algorithms in databases we propose a decentralized topk query evaluation algorithm for peertopeer networks
Inspired by the success of ranking algorithms in Web search engine in databases we propose a decentralized topk query evaluation algorithm for peertopeer networks
peertopeer networks which makes use of local rankings rank optimized routing based on peer ranks
peertopeer networks which minimizes both answer
peertopeer networks which makes use of local rankings rank merging
As our algorithm is based on dynamically collected query statistics only no continuous index update processes are necessary allowing our algorithm to scale easily to large numbers of peers
