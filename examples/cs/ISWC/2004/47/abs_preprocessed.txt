the available ontologies are seen as the solution to data heterogeneity on the web
however the available ontologies are the available ontologies source of heterogeneity
this can be overcome by finding the correspondence between the available ontologies components
this can be overcome by aligning ontologies
these alignments deserve to be treated as objects these alignments can be referenced on the web as such
these alignments deserve to be treated as objects these alignments can be compared with other alignments
these alignments deserve to be treated as objects these alignments can be transformed into a set of axioms
these alignments deserve to be treated as objects these alignments can be transformed into a set of a translation program
these alignments deserve to be treated as objects these alignments can be completed by an algorithm
an algorithm that improves a particular alignment
we present here a format for expressing alignments in rdf so that these alignments can be published on the web
an alignment api which shares some design goals with the owl api
then we propose an implementation of this format as an alignment api
an alignment api which can be seen as an extension of the owl api
we show how the owl api can be used for effectively aligning ontologies
we show how the owl api can be used for completing partial alignments generating axioms and transformations
we show how the owl api can be used for completing partial alignments thresholding alignments
