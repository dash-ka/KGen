successful employment of semantic web services depends on the availability of high quality ontologies to describe the domains of semantic web services
as always building such ontologies is costly thus hampering web service deployment
as always building such ontologies is difficult thus hampering web service deployment
our hypothesis is that since the functionality is reflected by the underlying software the extracted ontologies could be built by analyzing the documentation of the underlying software
the functionality offered by a web service
our verify this hypothesis in the domain of rdf ontology storage tools
our implemented
our finetuned a semiautomatic method to extract domain ontologies from software documentation
the quality of the extracted ontologies was verified against a high quality handbuilt ontology of the same domain
despite the low linguistic quality of the corpus our method allows extracting a considerable amount of information for a domain ontology
