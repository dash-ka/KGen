a description logic that is a fragment of classical firstorder predicate logic
owl a description logic corresponds to a description logic
therefore the standard methods of automated reasoning for full classical firstorder predicate logic can potentially be dedicated a description logic reasoners to solve owl a description logic reasoning tasks
therefore the standard methods of automated reasoning for full classical firstorder predicate logic can potentially be used a description logic reasoners to solve owl a description logic reasoning tasks
some experiments designed to explore the feasibility of using existing generalpurpose classical firstorder predicate logic provers to reason with owl a description logic
in this paper we report on some experiments
we also extend we approach to a proposed rule language extension to owl
we also extend we approach to swrl
