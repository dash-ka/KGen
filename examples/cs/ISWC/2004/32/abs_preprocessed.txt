a Description Logic that is a fragment of classical firstorder predicate logic
OWL a Description Logic corresponds to a Description Logic
Therefore the standard methods of automated reasoning for full classical firstorder predicate logic can potentially be used a Description Logic reasoners to solve OWL a Description Logic reasoning tasks
Therefore the standard methods of automated reasoning for full classical firstorder predicate logic can potentially be dedicated a Description Logic reasoners to solve OWL a Description Logic reasoning tasks
In this paper we report on some experiments
some experiments designed to explore the feasibility of using existing generalpurpose classical firstorder predicate logic provers to reason with OWL a Description Logic
we also extend we approach to SWRL 
we also extend we approach to a proposed rule language extension to OWL
