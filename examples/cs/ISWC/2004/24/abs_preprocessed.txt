we have seen an increasing amount of interest in the application of semantic web technologies to web services
the services allowing seamless interoperability
the aim is to support automated discovery and composition of the services
the services allowing transparent interoperability
in this paper we discuss three projects mygrid
in this paper we discuss three projects semanticmoby
in this paper we discuss three projects mobyservices
three projects that are applying such technologies to bioinformatics
through an examination of the differences and similarities between the solutions produced we suggest that the experiences with three projects semanticmoby have implications for the development of semantic web services as a whole
through an examination of the differences and similarities between the solutions produced we highlight some of the practical difficulties in developing semantic web services
