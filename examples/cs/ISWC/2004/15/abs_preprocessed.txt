the phenomenon has helped realize an initial goal of the semantic web
the phenomenon known as web logging 
the phenomenon known as  blogging  
as the semantic web unfolds we feel there are two questions worth posing exploited
as the semantic web unfolds we feel there are two questions worth posing do blog entries have semantic structure
semantic structure that can be usefully captured
is blogging a natural way to encourage growth of the semantic web
we explore empirical evidence for answering two questions worth posing do blog entries have semantic structure and propose means to bring blogging into the mainstream of the semantic web including ontologies 09 x2 0 files
ontologies that extend an xsl transform for handling rss
ontologies that extend the rss 10 specification transform for handling rss
semantic structure that can be usefully captured in the affirmative
semantic structure that can be usefully exploited in the affirmative
to demonstrate the validity of our approach our have constructed a semantic blogging environment based on haystack
our argue that with tools such as haystack semantic blogging will be an important paradigm
an important paradigm by which metadata authoring will occur in the future
