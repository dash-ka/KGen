we focus on the induction and revision of terminologies from metadata
operators that traverse the search space
the search space expressed in a structural representation
following a machine learning approach this setting can be cast as a search problem to be solved employing operators aiming at correct concept definitions
the progressive refinement of such definitions in a terminology is driven by the available extensional knowledge
description logics which are endowed with wellfounded reasoning capabilities
a knowledgeintensive inductive approach to this task is presented that can deal with on the expressive semantic web representations
the expressive semantic web representations based on description logics
the core inferential mechanism can be used for either inducing new concept descriptions or refining existing ones
the core inferential mechanism based on multilevel counterfactuals
