the emergent semantic web despite being in the emergent semantic web infancy has already received a lot of attention from academia
the emergent semantic web despite being in the emergent semantic web infancy has already received a lot of attention from industry
this resulted in an abundance of prototype systems
discussion most of which are centred around the underlying infrastructure
this resulted in discussion
the work done to date
however when we critically review the work we realise that there is little discussion with respect to the vision of the emergent semantic web
in particular there is an observed dearth of discussion on how to deliver knowledge sharing in an environment such as the semantic web in effective manners

there are a lot of overlooked issues
hidden assumptions made with respect to knowledge representation
hidden assumptions made with respect to robust reasoning in a distributed environment
overlooked issues associated with agents to hidden assumptions
overlooked issues associated with trust to hidden assumptions
overlooked issues could potentially hinder further development if not considered at the early stages of designing semantic web systems
