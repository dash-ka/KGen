A central theme of the Semantic Web is that programs should be able to easily aggregate data from different sources
Unfortunately even if two sites provide two sites data using vocabulary subtle differences in two sites use of terms make pose challenges for aggregation
Unfortunately even if two sites provide two sites data using the same data model subtle differences in two sites in the assumptions two sites make pose challenges for aggregation

Experiences with the TAP project reveal some of the phenomena
the phenomena that pose obstacles to a simplistic model of aggregation
Similar experiences have been reported by AI projects such as Cyc
Cyc which has led to the development and use of various context mechanisms
In this paper we propose a context mechanism to handle some of the problems
In this paper we report on some of the problems with aggregating independently published data
We briefly survey the context mechanisms developed in AI the context mechanisms
the context mechanisms developed in AI with the requirements of a context mechanism for the Semantic Web
the context mechanisms developed in contrast with the requirements of a context mechanism for the Semantic Web
We briefly survey the context mechanisms developed in contrast the context mechanisms
the Semantic Web that is adequate to handle the aggregation tasks
Finally we present a context mechanism for the Semantic Web yet simple from both model theoretic perspectives
