we introduce some infrequently used features of http1 1 in order to support addressing
we introduce server side processing of resource operations
we introduce some infrequently useful features of http1 1 in order to support addressing
we introduce xpointer
we introduce server side processing of subresource operations
we consider applications of the xpointer framework for use in the semantic web particularly for owl resources
we consider applications of the xpointer framework for use in the semantic web particularly for subresources
we consider applications of the xpointer framework for use in the semantic web particularly for rdf resources
we describe rdf subresource selection
we describe two initial implementations filtering of rss resources by date range
rdf subresource selection using rdql
we describe two initial implementations filtering of rss resources by item range
finally we describe possible application to the problem of owl imports
