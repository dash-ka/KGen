one of the original motivations behind ontology research was the belief
the belief that ontologies can help with reuse in knowledge representation
however many of the ontologies are extremely large while the users often need to reuse only a small part of these resources in many of the ontologies such as standard reference ontologies
the ontologies that are developed with reuse in mind such as standard reference ontologies
the ontologies that are developed with reuse in mind
the ontologies that are developed with reuse in mind such as controlled terminologies
however many of the ontologies are extremely large while the users often need to reuse only a small part of these resources in many of the ontologies such as controlled terminologies work
specifying various views of an ontology enables users to limit the set of concepts that users see
a view where a user specifies concepts of interest
in this paper we develop the concept of a traversal view a view
in this paper we develop the concept of a traversal view the relationships to traverse to find other concepts to include in the view
a view where a user specifies the central concept
in this paper we develop the concept of a traversal view the depth of the traversal
organs that surround heart
organ parts that are contained in heart
for example given a large ontology of anatomy a user may use a traversal view to extract a concept of heart
