The increasing awareness of the benefits of these ontologies has lead to the creation of a number of large ontologies about realworld domains
The size of these ontologies because serious problems in handling these ontologies
The size of these ontologies monolithic character because serious problems in handling these ontologies
In other areas eg software engineering these problems are tackled by partitioning monolithic entities into sets of mostly selfcontained modules
In other areas eg software engineering these problems are tackled by partitioning monolithic entities into sets of meaningful modules
In this paper we suggest a similar approach for ontologies
smaller modules based on the structure of the class hierarchy
We propose a method for automatically partitioning large ontologies into smaller modules
We show that the structurebased method performs surprisingly well on realworld ontologies

We support this claim by these experiments carried out on realworld ontologies
We support this claim by these experiments carried out on
