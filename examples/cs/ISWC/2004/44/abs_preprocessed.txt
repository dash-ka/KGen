As the use of Semantic Web ontologies continues to expand there is a growing need for tools
tools that can validate ontological consistency
tools that can provide guidance in the correction of detected defects and errors
A number of tools already exist as evidenced by the ten systems
the ten systems participating in the W3Cs evaluation of the OWL Test Cases
For the most part these first generation tools focus on experimental approaches to consistency checking while minimal attention is paid to how the results will be used
For the most part these first generation tools focus on experimental approaches to consistency checking how the systems might interoperate
For this reason very few of the systems produce results in a machinereadable format  for example as OWL annotations  and there is no shared notion across the tools of how to describe what it is that makes annotation inconsistent
For this reason very few of the systems produce results in a machinereadable format  for example as OWL annotations  and there is no shared notion across the tools of how to identify what it is that makes a specific ontology inconsistent

the Semantic Web that would serve as a common language for describing semantic errors and warnings
semantic errors and warnings that may be indicative of inconsistencies in annotations
semantic errors and warnings that may be indicative of inconsistencies in ontologies
In this paper we propose the development of a Symptom Ontology for the Semantic Web we refer to such errors and warnings as symptoms
the Semantic Web that would serve as a common language for identifying semantic errors and warnings
We offer the symptom ontology currently used by the ConsVISor consistencychecking tool as the starting point for a discussion on the desirable characteristics of such an ontology
Included among the desirable characteristics of such an ontology are the axioms of the languages specific symptoms violate
Included among the desirable characteristics of such an ontology are 2  clear associations between specific symptoms 3  a means for relating individual symptoms back to the specific constructs in the input file
Included among the desirable characteristics of such an ontology are 2  clear associations between specific symptoms specific symptoms violate
the input file through which specific symptoms were implicated
Included among the desirable characteristics of such an ontology are 1  a hierarchy of common symptoms 3  a means for relating individual symptoms back to the specific constructs in the input file
