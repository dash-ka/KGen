Magpie is a suite of tools Magpie avoids the need for manual annotation by automatically associating an ontologybased semantic layer to web resources
tools supporting a  zerocost  approach to semantic web browsing
An important aspect of Magpie is that the association between items on a web page is not merely a mechanism for dynamic
the association between items on semantic concepts is the enabling condition for making These services available to a user
An important aspect of Magpie is that the association between items on semantic concepts is not merely a mechanism for dynamic
the association between items on a web page is the enabling condition for making These services available to a user
the association between items on a web page is the enabling condition for locating These services
dynamic linking
Magpie which differentiates Magpie from superficially similar hypermedia systems
the association between items on semantic concepts is the enabling condition for locating These services
These services can be manually activated by pull services 
These services can be triggered when the appropriate web entities are encountered during push services 
These services can be triggered when the appropriate web entities are encountered during a browsing session 
These services can be manually activated by a user 
open as to services  which is a key aspect of the emerging semantic web
we note that earlier implementations did not fulfill the criterion of  open as to services 
In this paper we analyze Magpie from the perspective of building semantic web applications
a radical redesign of Magpie resulting in a novel architecture
For this reason in the past twelve months we have carried out a radical redesign of Magpie
a novel architecture which is open both with respect to semantic web services
a novel architecture which is open both with respect to ontologies
a novel architecture can be seen as a software framework for implementing semantic web applications
a novel architecture which is open both with respect to ontologies
a novel architecture which is open both with respect to semantic web services
a novel architecture goes beyond the idea of merely providing support for semantic web browsing
a novel architecture can be seen as a software framework for designing semantic web applications
