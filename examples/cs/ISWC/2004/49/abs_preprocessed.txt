a knowledgebased environment that enables information to be retrieved effectively
a knowledgebased environment that enables information to be shared effectively
Semantic Web provides a knowledgebased environment
In this research we propose the Scholarly Semantic Web for the sharing reuse and management of scholarly information
data which is a tedious task
data which is a difficult task
To support the Scholarly Semantic Web for the sharing reuse and management of scholarly information we need to construct ontology from data
To generate ontology automatically Formal Concept Analysis is an effective technique
an effective technique that can formally abstract data as conceptual structures
To enable Formal Concept Analysis to interpret the concept hierarchy reasonably we propose to incorporate fuzzy logic into Formal Concept Analysis for automatic generation of ontology
To enable Formal Concept Analysis to deal with uncertainty in data we propose to incorporate fuzzy logic into Formal Concept Analysis for automatic generation of ontology
The proposed new framework is known as Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis
In this paper we will discuss the Scholarly Semantic Web for the sharing
In this paper we will discuss management of scholarly information
In this paper we will discuss reuse of scholarly information
In this paper we will discuss the ontology generation process from The proposed new framework
In addition the performance of the Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis framework for ontology generation will also be evaluated
In addition the performance of the Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis framework for ontology generation will also be presented
