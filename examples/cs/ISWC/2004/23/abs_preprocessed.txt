Web Services especially when described using S service ontologies
Web Services especially when described using the OWL
Hierarchical TaskNetwork have been applied to the problem of composing Web Services
Hierarchical TaskNetwork based planning techniques
Many of the existing Web Services depend on informationproviding services
Many of the existing Web Services are either exclusively information providing
Thus many interesting service compositions involve collecting information either during execution the composition process itself
Thus many interesting service compositions involve collecting information either during the composition process the composition process itself
In this paper we focus on the latter issue
an HTNplanning algorithm designed for planning domains
planning domains in which the information about the initial state of the world may not be complete
In particular we present an HTNplanning algorithm
In particular we present ENQUIRER
the information about the initial state of the world is discoverable through plantime informationgathering queries
we have derived the likelihood of the planner
the plan found
we have derived several mathematical relationships among the amount of available information
the plan found
we have shown that ENQUIRER is sound
we have shown that ENQUIRER is complete
we have derived the quality of the plan
the planner finding the plan
we have performed experimental tests that confirmed we theoretical results
we have performed experimental tests that demonstrated how ENQUIRER can be used in Web Service composition
