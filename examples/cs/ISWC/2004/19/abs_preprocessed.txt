In this paper we present an evaluation of four knowledge base systems with respect to use in large OWL applications
To our knowledge no experiment has been done with the scale of data
data used here
999 files totaling 583 MB
The smallest dataset used consists of 15 OWL files totaling 8 MB while The smallest dataset consists of 999 files
our evaluated two systems with persistent storage 
our evaluated two memorybased systems 
our evaluated memorybased Sesame 
our evaluated two systems with DLDBOWL 
our evaluated two systems with databasebased Sesame 
our evaluated OWLJessKB 
our describe what factors our have considered in the evaluation
our describe how our have performed the evaluation
our discuss the performance of each system
our show the results of the experiment
In particular our have concluded that existing systems need to place a greater emphasis on scalability
