a physical layer consisting of a structured peertopeer overlay network for efficient routing of messages
Our approach follows the principle of data independence by separating the semantic overlay for mapping data from a physical layer
Our approach follows the principle of data independence by separating a logical layer from a physical layer
a physical layer consisting of a structured peertopeer overlay network for efficient routing of messages
a physical layer is used to implement various functions at a physical layer including schema mapping management
a physical layer is used to implement various functions at a physical layer including attributebased search
a physical layer is used to implement various functions at a physical layer including schema management
a physical layer consisting of a structured peertopeer overlay network for efficient routing of messages
The separation of a physical from a logical layer allows us to process logical operations in the semantic overlay
the semantic overlay using different physical execution strategies
In particular we identify iterative strategies for the traversal of semantic overlay networks as two important alternatives
In particular we identify recursive strategies for the traversal of semantic overlay networks as two important alternatives
a physical layer consisting of a structured peertopeer overlay network for efficient routing of messages
At a physical layer we support semantic interoperability through schema inheritance
At a physical layer we support semantic interoperability through Semantic Gossiping
semantic overlay networks supporting both scalability
Thus our system provides a complete solution to the implementation of semantic overlay networks
