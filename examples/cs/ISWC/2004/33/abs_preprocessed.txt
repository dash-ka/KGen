which relies on the full power of the rdfs data model for constructing on the fly queries
the fly queries expressed in rql
a novel interface called grql
grql
in this paper we present a novel interface
path expressions required to access the resources of interest
more precisely a user can generate transparently the rql path expressions
more precisely a user can navigate graphically through the individual rdfs class
more precisely a user can navigate graphically through property definitions
path expressions required to access the resources of interest capture accurately the meaning of its navigation steps through the class  or property  subsumption andor associations
the resources class appearing in the query result
additionally users can enrich the generated queries with filtering conditions on the attributes of the currently visited class while users can easily specify the resources class
to the best of our knowledge grql is the first applicationindependent gui able to generate a unique rql query
a unique rql query which captures the cumulative effect of an entire user navigation session
