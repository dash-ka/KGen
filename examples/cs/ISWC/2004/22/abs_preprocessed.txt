the semantic web services vision requires that each service be annotated with semantic metadata
manually creating such metadata is errorprone
tools that automatically generate wsdl
manually creating such metadata is tedious
many software engineers accustomed to tools
many software engineers might not want to invest the additional effort
a tool that assists a user in creating semantic metadata for web services
we therefore propose assams a tool
assams is intended for service consumers
service consumers who want to integrate a number of services
service consumers who therefore must annotate a number of services according to some shared ontology
assams want to make assams compatible with an existing ontology
service producers who have deployed a web service
assams is also relevant for service producers
assams capabilities to automatically create semantic metadata are supported by two machine learning algorithms
first assams have developed an iterative relational classification algorithm for semantically classifying input messages
first assams have developed an iterative relational classification algorithm for semantically classifying output messages
first assams have developed an iterative relational classification algorithm for semantically classifying web services
first assams have developed an iterative relational classification algorithm for semantically classifying assams operations
second to aggregate the data have developed a schema mapping algorithm
a schema mapping algorithm that is based on an ensemble of string distance metrics
the data returned by multiple semantically related web services assams
