an open environment populated by large numbers of heterogeneous information services
in an open environment integration is a major challenge
in such a setting the efficient coupling between service composition engines is crucial
in such a setting the efficient coupling between directorybased service discovery is crucial
a directory service that offers specific functionality in order to enable efficient service integration
in this paper we present a directory service
the directory implementation relies on a multidimensional index structure
the directory implementation relies on a compact numerical encoding of service parameters
the directory implementation supports isolated service integration sessions
isolated service integration sessions providing a consistent view of the directory data
during a session a client may retrieve the results incrementally
during a session a client may issue multiple queries to the directory
in order to optimize the interaction of the directory with different service composition algorithms the directory supports custom ranking functions
custom ranking functions that are dynamically installed with the aid of mobile code
the directory service imposes severe restrictions on the programming model in order to protect the directory service against erroneous code 
the directory service imposes severe restrictions on the programming model in order to protect the directory service against eg denialofservice attacks 
the directory service imposes severe restrictions on the programming model in order to protect the directory service against malicious code 
the ranking functions are written in java
applicationspecific ordering heuristics
with the aid of userdefined ranking functions applicationspecific can be deployed directly
experiments on randomly generated problems show that randomly generated problems significantly reduce the number of query results that have to be transmitted to the client by up to 5 times
