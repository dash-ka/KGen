Both OWLDL are decidable logics with interesting yet orthogonal expressive power from the rules perspective OWLDL is restricted to treelike rules but provides both existentially and universally quantified variables
Both OWLDL are decidable logics with interesting yet orthogonal expressive power from the rules perspective OWLDL is restricted to treelike rules but provides both existentially and universally quantified full monotonic negation
functionfree Horn rules are decidable logics with interesting yet orthogonal expressive power from the rules perspective OWLDL is restricted to treelike rules but provides both existentially and universally quantified variables
functionfree Horn rules are decidable logics with interesting yet orthogonal expressive power from the rules perspective OWLDL is restricted to treelike rules but provides both existentially and universally quantified full monotonic negation
From the description logic perspective rules allow for the interaction of variables in arbitrary ways
From the description logic perspective rules are restricted to universal quantification
a combination of OWLDL is desirable for building Semantic Web ontologies
a combination of rules is desirable for building Semantic Web ontologies
several such combinations have already been discussed
Clearly
However such a combination might easily lead to the undecidability of interesting reasoning problems
Here we present a decidable such combination
a decidable such combination which is to the best of we knowledge more general than similar decidable combinations
similar decidable combinations proposed so far
Decidability is obtained by restricting rules to socalled DLsafe ones requiring each variable in a rule to occur in a nonDLatom in the rule body
we show that query answering in such a combined logic is decidable
we discuss query answering in such a combined logic expressive power by means of a nontrivial example
Finally we present an algorithm for query answering in SHIQ extended with DLsafe rules based on the reduction to disjunctive datalog
