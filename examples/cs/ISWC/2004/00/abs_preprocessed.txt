this talk explores aspects relevant for peertopeer search infrastructures
peertopeer search infrastructures which we think are better suited to semantic web search than centralized approaches
this talk does so in the form of an  incomplete  cookbook recipe
an  incomplete  cookbook recipe listing necessary ingredients for putting together a distributed search infrastructure
the reader has to be aware though that the reader needs quite a few more research papers on these aspects before we can really serve the final infrastructure
the reader has to be aware though that many of these ingredients are research questions before we can really serve the final infrastructure
the reader has to be aware though that many of these ingredients are solutions before we can really serve the final infrastructure
the reader has to be aware though that many of these ingredients are research questions before we can really cook the final infrastructure
the reader has to be aware though that many of these ingredients are solutions before we can really cook the final infrastructure
the reader has to be aware though that the reader needs quite a few more research papers on these aspects before we can really cook the final infrastructure
appropriate references as examples for the aspects discussed
we will include appropriate references as examples for the aspects  with some bias to we own work at l3s  though a complete literature overview would go well beyond cookbook recipe length limits
