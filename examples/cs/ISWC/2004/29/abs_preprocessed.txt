in this paper we describe we experience in applying kaos services to ensure policy compliance for semantic web services workflow composition and enactment
we are developing these capabilities within the context of two applications coalition search
we are developing these capabilities within rescue
we are developing these capabilities within semantic firewall
we describe how we are extending we reasoning mechanisms in a carefully controlled manner to that end
we describe how we are extending we representation mechanisms in a carefully controlled manner to that end
we describe how this work has uncovered requirements for increasing the expressivity of policy beyond what can be done with eg rolevaluemaps 
we describe how this work has uncovered requirements for increasing the expressivity of policy beyond what can be done with description logic 
since kaos employs owl for policy representation policy representation fits naturally with the use of owls workflow descriptions
owls workflow descriptions generated by the aiai ix planning system in the rescue application
the advanced reasoning mechanisms of kaos are enable the analysis of classes of processes from a policy perspective
the advanced reasoning mechanisms of kaos are enable the analysis of instances of processes from a policy perspective
the advanced reasoning mechanisms of kaos are based on the jtp inference engine
as the result of analysis kaos concludes whether a particular workflow step is allowed by policy
as the result of analysis kaos concludes whether the performance of a particular workflow step would incur additional policygenerated obligations
issues in the representation of processes within owls are described
besides what is done during workflow composition aspects of policy compliance can be checked at runtime when a workflow is enacted
we illustrate these capabilities through two application examples
finally we outline plans for future work
