the development of intelligent agents is a key part of the semantic web vision
how does an ordinary person tell an agent
an agent what to do
rdf templates that are authored once
one approach to this problem is to use rdf templates
rdf templates that then instantiated many times by ordinary users
one approach to this problem however raises a number of challenges
for instance how can templates concisely represent a broad range of potential uses yet ensure that each possible instantiation will function properly
the humans involved
and how does an agent explain an agent
an agent what to do actions to the humans
an agent what to do
this paper addresses these challenges in the context of a case study carried out on our fullydeployed system for semantic email agents
our describe how highlevel features of our template language enable the concise specification of flexible goals
in response to the first question our show that it is possible to verify in polynomial time that a given template will always produce a valid instantiation
second our show can be computed in polynomial time
an agent what to identify cases where explanations
our show how to automatically generate explanations for an agent
an agent what to do actions
these results both improve the usefulness of semantic email
these results both suggest general issues and techniques
general issues and techniques that may be applicable in other semantic web systems
