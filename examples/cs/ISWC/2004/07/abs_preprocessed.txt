data forcing life science researchers to apply the same rigor to life science researchers
life science researchers increasingly rely on the web as a primary source of data use as to an experiment in the laboratory
the mygrid project is developing the use of provenance to describe why results were produced
the mygrid project is developing the use of provenance to describe how results were produced
the mygrid project is developing the use of workflows to explicitly capture webbased procedures
heterogenous resources that impact on the production of a result
experience within mygrid has shown that this provenance metadata is formed from a complex web of heterogenous resources
therefore we have used existing initiatives such as jena to generate such material
therefore we have used existing initiatives such as lsid to generate such material
therefore we have used existing initiatives such as lsid to store such material
therefore we have explored the use of semantic web technologies such as rdf and ontologies to support ontologies representation
therefore we have used existing initiatives such as jena to store such material
the effective presentation of complex rdf graphs is challenging
provenance metadata that can be further annotated
haystack has been used to provide multiple views of provenance metadata
this work therefore forms a case study
a case study showing how existing semantic web tools can effectively support the emerging requirements of life science research
