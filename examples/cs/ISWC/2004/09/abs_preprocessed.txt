bibster exploits ontologies in data storage query formulation query when bibliographic entries are made available for use in a peertopeer system for exchanging bibliographic data among researchers bibliographic entries are structured according to two different ontologies
this ontological structure is then exploited to help users formulate users queries
subsequently two different ontologies are used to improve query
query routing across the peertopeer network
finally two different ontologies are used to postprocess the returned answers in order to do duplicate detection
this paper describes each of these ontologybased aspects of bibster
