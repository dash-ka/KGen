Semantic annotations of web services can facilitate services composition into workflows
Semantic annotations of web services can facilitate the discovery of services
At present however the practical utility of such annotations is limited by the small number of service annotations available for general use
therefore some means is required by which services can be automatically  or semiautomatically  annotated
Resources for manual annotation are scarce
operation parameters based on this paper connections to annotated  operation parameters within triedandtested workflows
In this paper we show how information can be inferred about the semantics of operation parameters
operation parameters based on this paper connections to other  operation parameters within triedandtested workflows
these socalled loose annotations are still of value in detecting errors within ontologies
In an openworld context we can infer only constraints on the semantics of parameters
these socalled loose annotations are still of value in detecting errors within annotations
these socalled loose annotations are still of value in detecting errors within workflows
these socalled loose annotations are still in simplifying the manual annotation task
