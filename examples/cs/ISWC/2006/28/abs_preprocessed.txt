we study the problem of evaluating conjunctive queries stored in distributed hash tables
conjunctive queries composed of triple patterns over rdf data
algorithms that scale to large amounts of rdf data
we goal is to incur little network traffic
we goal is to develop algorithms
we goal is to distribute the query processing load evenly
we present two novel query processing algorithms with these possibly conflicting goals in mind
we evaluate two novel query processing algorithms with these possibly conflicting goals in mind
we setting through a detailed experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms
we discuss the various tradeoffs
the various tradeoffs that occur in we
