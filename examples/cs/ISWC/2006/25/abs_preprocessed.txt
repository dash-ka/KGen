In recent years workflows have been increasingly used in scientific applications
This paper presents novel metadata reasoning capabilities that we have developed to support the creation of large workflows
metadata needed for workflow creation
This paper include 2  propagation of metadata constraints from inputs to outputs in a workflow component
This paper include 1  use of semantic web technologies in handling metadata constraints on file collections
This paper include 2  validation of metadata constraints from inputs through the links among components in a workflow
This paper include 2  validation of metadata constraints from inputs to outputs in a workflow component
This paper include 3  subworkflows that generate metadata
This paper include 2  propagation of metadata constraints from inputs through the links among components in a workflow
This paper include 1  use of semantic web technologies in handling metadata constraints on file nested file collections
We show how We used these capabilities to support the creation of large executable workflows in an earthquake science application with more than 7000 jobs generating metadata for more than 100000 new files
