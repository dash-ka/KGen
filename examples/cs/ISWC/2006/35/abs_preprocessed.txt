Logic programming is often seen as a way to perform closedworld querying
Logic programming is often seen as a way to overcome several shortcomings of the Web Ontology Language such as the inability to model integrity constraints
However the openworld semantics of the Web Ontology Language seems to be fundamentally incompatible with the closedworld semantics of Logic programming
This has sparked a heated debate in the the Semantic Web community
a heated debate in the the Semantic Web community resulting in proposals for alternative ontology languages
alternative ontology languages based entirely on logic programming
the practical use cases which seem to be addressed by logic programming
To help resolving a heated debate in the Semantic Web community we investigate the practical use cases
In fact many of these requirements have already been addressed outside the Semantic Web
By drawing inspiration from these existing formalisms we present a novel logic of hybrid MKNF knowledge bases
hybrid MKNF knowledge bases which seamlessly integrates the Web Ontology Language with Logic programming
we are thus capable of addressing the identified use cases without a radical change in the architecture of the Semantic Web
