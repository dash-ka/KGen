with the wider use of ontologies in the semantic web multiple scenarios for ontology maintenance and evolution are emerging
with the wider use of ontologies as part of production systems multiple scenarios for ontology maintenance and evolution are emerging
managers of projects may exercise quality control
examining changes from previous baseline versions is published
successive ontology versions can be posted on the  semantic  web with users
ontologydevelopment in a collaborative environment can be synchronous

users discovering the new versions serendipitously
rejecting managers of projects before a new baseline is published
for example
ontologydevelopment in a collaborative environment can be asynchronous
accepting managers of projects before a new baseline is published
in this paper we present different scenarios for ontology maintenance and evolution that we have encountered in we own projects collaborators
in this paper we present different scenarios for ontology maintenance and evolution that we have encountered in we own in those of we collaborators
we define several features
several features that categorize these scenarios
for each scenario we discuss the highlevel tasks that an editing environment must support
we then present a unified comprehensive set of tools to support different scenarios in a single framework allowing users to switch between different modes easily
