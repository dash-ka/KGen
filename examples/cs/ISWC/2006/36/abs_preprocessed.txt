recently the use of blogs has been a remarkable means to publish user interests
in order to find suitable information resources from a large amount of blog entries we need an information filtering technique to automatically transcribe user interests to a user profile in detail
blog entries which are published every day
in this paper we first classify user blog entries into service domain ontologies
service domain ontologies that express a users interests semantically as a hierarchy of classes according to interest weight by a topdown approach
extract interest ontologies that express a users interests semantically as a hierarchy of classes according to interest weight by a topdown approach
in this paper we first classify user blog entries into extract interest ontologies
next with a bottomup approach users modify users interest ontologies to update users interests in more detail
furthermore we propose a similarity measurement between ontologies
the interest weight assigned to each class and instance
ontologies considering the interest weight
then we detect innovative blog entries
innovative blog entries that include concepts that the user has not thought about in the past
the past based on the analysis of approximated ontologies of a users interests
we present experimental results
experimental results that demonstrate the performance of we proposed methods using a largescale blog entries
experimental results that demonstrate the performance of we proposed methods using music domain ontologies
