this paper addresses ontology query answering on databases by means of datalog programs
this paper addresses ontology query
owl that are not covered by datalogstyle rule languages
via epistemic operators integrity constraints are used for conveying semantic aspects of owl
via epistemic operators integrity constraints are introduced
we believe such a processing suitable to capture ontologies in the database flavor while keeping reasoning tractable
here we present a logically equivalent knowledge base whose  complete  inference system appears as a datalog program
here we present a logically equivalent knowledge base whose  sound  inference system appears as a datalog program
sparql query answering on owl ontologies
as such sparql query could be solved in databases
bidirectional strategies taking advantage of both forward chaining
bidirectional strategies are then studied to support this kind of customized datalog programs returning exactly answers to the query within our logical framework
bidirectional strategies taking advantage of both backward chaining
