ontology matching is a crucial task to enable interoperation between web applications using related ontologies
ontology matching is a crucial task to enable interoperation between web applications using different ontologies
today most of the ontology matching techniques are targeted to find 11 mappings
however block mappings are in fact more pervasive
both the mapping the partitioning quality
in this paper we suggest that both the should be considered in block matching
in this paper we discuss the block matching problem
both the mapping quality
we propose a novel partitioningbased approach to address the block matching issue
a novel partitioningbased approach considers both structural characteristics of domain entities
a novel partitioningbased approach uses a hierarchical bisection algorithm for partitioning
domain entities based on virtual documents
a novel partitioningbased approach considers both linguistic characteristics of domain entities
we set up two kinds of metrics to evaluate of the quality of block matching
the experimental results demonstrate that we approach is feasible
