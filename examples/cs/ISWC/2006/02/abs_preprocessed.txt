SPARQL is the W3C candidate recommendation query language for RDF
the formal study of SPARQL concentrating in SPARQL graph pattern facility
In this paper we address systematically the formal study of SPARQL
we consider for the formal study of SPARQL simple RDF graphs without a simplified version of filters
filters which encompasses all the main issues
we consider for the formal study of SPARQL simple RDF graphs without special semantics for literals
we provide a compositional semantics prove there are normal forms prove complexity bounds among others that the evaluation of SPARQL patterns is PSPACEcomplete compare we semantics to an alternative operational semantics give natural conditions when our semantics coincide optimization procedures
