The core paradigm however remains what we call the Web aspect of the Semantic Web
The core paradigm however remains what we call distributed agents
distributed agents who publish data on the World Wide Web
distributed agents who consume data on the World Wide Web
The core paradigm however remains what we call the Semantic Web use by independent
To better understand this central use case we have harvested a collection of the World Wide Web documents from an estimated ten million available on the World Wide Web
To better understand this central use case we have analyzed a collection of the World Wide Web documents from an estimated ten million available on the World Wide Web
more than 17 million documents comprising over 300 million RDF triples
Using a corpus of more than 17 million documents we describe a number of global metrics properties
Using a corpus of more than 17 million documents we describe a number of usage patterns
Most of the metrics such as the size of the World Wide Web documents were found to follow a power law distribution
Most of the metrics such as the use frequency of the World Wide Web terms were found to follow a power law distribution
