We address the issue of extracting implicit relationships between entities in biomedical text
We address the issue of extracting explicit relationships between entities in biomedical text
We argue that entities seldom occur in text in entities that relationships in text relate the modified complex forms of entities with each other
We argue that entities seldom occur in text in entities simple form complex forms of entities with each other
We present a rulebased method for extraction of such complex entities and relationships between a rulebased method for extraction of such complex entities and relationships between them into RDF
We present a rulebased method for extraction of such complex entities and relationships between a rulebased method for the conversion of such relationships into RDF

paths composed of the extracted relationships
Furthermore we present results
results that clearly demonstrate the utility of the generated RDF in discovering knowledge from text corpora by means of locating paths
