In this paper we present an approach to adaptive probabilistic search for semantic web services in unstructured P2P networks
an approach called RS2D v1
Each service agent dynamically learns the averaged queryanswer behavior of Each service agent neighbor peers and forwards service requests to those with minimal mixed Bayesian risk of doing so in terms of commmunication cost
Each service agent dynamically learns the averaged queryanswer behavior of Each service agent neighbor peers and forwards service requests to those with minimal mixed Bayesian risk of doing so in terms of estimated semantic gain
Experimental evaluation shows that the RS2D search mechanism is robust against changes in the network compared to other existing relevant approaches
Experimental evaluation shows that the RS2D search mechanism is robust with reasonably high precision compared to other existing relevant approaches
