automated composition of the process of forming new value added web services is one of the most promising challenges in the semantic web service research area
semantics is one of the key elements for the automated composition of web services because such a process requires rich machineunderstandable descriptions of services
services that can be shared
semantics enables web service to describe web service capabilities and processes nevertheless there is still some work to be done
indeed web services need a formal context to perform the automated composition of web services
web services described at functional level
the suggested model  is a necessary starting point to apply problemsolving techniques such as regressionbased search for web service composition
ie causal link matrix  is a necessary starting point to apply problemsolving techniques such as regressionbased search for web service composition
the suggested model rrb supports a semantic context in order to find a optimal plan as a solution
