in recent years several measures for the gold standard were proposed
the gold standard based evaluation of ontology learning
several measures for the gold standard can be distinguished by the layers of an ontology  several measures for the gold standard
the gold standard based evaluation of ontology learning
several measures for the gold standard can be distinguished by the layers of eg lexical term layer  several measures for the gold standard

several measures for the gold standard can be distinguished by the layers of eg concept hierarchy  several measures for the gold standard
judging several measures for the gold standard we show that there exist some measures sufficient for evaluating the lexical term layer
the gold standard based evaluation of ontology learning with a list of criteria
however existing measures for the evaluation of concept hierarchies fail to meet basic criteria
this paper presents a new taxonomic measure
a new taxonomic measure which overcomes the problems of current approaches
