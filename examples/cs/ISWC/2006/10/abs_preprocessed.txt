the casual user is typically overwhelmed by the formal logic of the semantic web
the gap between the end user has to be bridged if the semantic web capabilities are to be utilized by the general public
the gap between the logicbased scaffolding has to be bridged if the semantic web capabilities are to be utilized by the general public
this paper proposes that controlled natural languages offer one way to bridge the gap between the logicbased scaffolding
this paper proposes that controlled natural languages offer one way to bridge the gap between the end user
we introduce gino
natural language ontology editor that allows users to edit ontologies in a language akin to english
natural language ontology editor that allows users to query ontologies in a language akin to english
we introduce a guided input natural language ontology editor
a small static grammar which this paper dynamically extends with elements from the loaded ontologies
this paper uses a small static grammar
the usability evaluation shows that gino is wellsuited for novice users when editing ontologies
natural language ontology editor that allows users to query ontologies in a language akin to english
natural language ontology editor that allows users to edit ontologies in a language akin to english
the usability evaluation shows that a guided input natural language ontology editor is wellsuited for novice users when editing ontologies
thehabitability problem which adversely affects most natural language systems
we believe that the use of guided entry overcomes thehabitability problem
additionally the approachs dynamic grammar generation allows for easy adaptation to new ontologies
