our empirical study shows that strong dependencies exist across different types of information  it means that identification of one kind of information can be used for identifying the other kind of information 
the large volume of web content needs to be annotated by ontologies  called semantic annotation 
conditional random fields are the stateoftheart approaches for modeling the dependencies to do better annotation
however as information on a web page is not necessarily linearly laidout the previous linearchain conditional random fields have the previous linearchain conditional random fields limitations in semantic annotation
this paper is concerned with semantic annotation on hierarchical semantic annotation 
this paper is concerned with semantic annotation on hierarchically dependent data 
we propose tcrf  model to better incorporate dependencies across the hierarchically laidout information
we propose a treestructured conditional random field  model to better incorporate dependencies across the hierarchically laidout information
methods for performing the tasks of modelparameter estimation and annotation in tcrfs have been proposed
experimental results indicate that the proposed tcrfs for hierarchical semantic annotation can significantly outperform the existing linearchain conditional random field model
