The technical challenges have been subject to a considerable number of research initiatives since the beginning of the nineties
The technical challenges associated with the development and deployment of ontologies
The economical aspects of these processes are however still poorly exploited impeding the dissemination of ontologydriven technologies beyond the boundaries of the academic community
This paper aims at contributing to the alleviation of this situation by proposing Ontology Cost Model 
This paper aims at contributing to the alleviation of this situation by proposing ONTOCOM 
This paper aims at contributing to the alleviation of this situation by proposing a model to predict the costs
the costs arising in ontology engineering processes
We introduce an inventory of cost drivers
We introduce a methodology to generate a cost model adapted to a particular ontology development strategy
effort invested in activities
activities performed during an ontology life cycle
cost drivers which influence the amount of effort
36 data points collected from realworld projects
We further present the results of the model validation procedure
the model validation procedure which covered an expertdriven evaluation on 36 data points
the model validation procedure which covered a statistical calibration on 36 data points
The validation revealed that ontology engineering processes have a high learning rate
a high learning rate indicating that the building of very large ontologies is feasible from an economic point of view
Moreover the complexity of conceptualization activities proved to have a major impact on the final ontology engineering process duration
Moreover the complexity of ontology evaluation proved to have a major impact on the final ontology engineering process duration
Moreover the complexity of domain analysis proved to have a major impact on the final ontology engineering process duration
