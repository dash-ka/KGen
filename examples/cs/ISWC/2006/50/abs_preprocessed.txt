In our research to use information extraction to help populate the semantic web our have encountered significant obstacles to interoperability between the technologies
our believe significant obstacles to be endemic to quirks of the specific implementations our have worked with
our believe significant obstacles to be endemic to the basic paradigms our have worked with
interoperability that must be addressed to successfully populate semantic web knowledge bases from information extraction systems
information extraction systems that are suitable for reasoning
In particular we identify five dimensions of interoperability
KITE in which our are exploring five dimensions of interoperability
information extraction systems that are suitable for reasoning
interoperability that must be addressed to successfully populate semantic web knowledge bases from information extraction systems
our call the task of transforming IE data into knowledgebases knowledge integration and briefly present a framework called KITE
Finally our report on the initial results of an experiment in which the knowledge integration process uses the deeper semantics of OWL ontologies to improve the precision of relation extraction from text
