an ontology language developed by the w3c
owl is an ontology language
although initially developed for the semantic web owl has rapidly become a de facto standard for ontology development in general
the specification includes a formal semantics
the design of owl was heavily influenced by research in description logics
one of the goals of this formal approach was to provide interoperability different owl reasoners should provide the same results when processing the same ontologies
a system that allows users to test owl reasoners using an extensible library of reallife ontologies to check the  correctness  of owl reasoners by comparing the computed class hierarchy to compare the performance of owl reasoners when to use sql queries to analyse the results in any way

a system that allows users to test owl reasoners using an extensible library of reallife ontologies to check the  correctness  of owl reasoners by comparing the computed class hierarchy to compare the performance of owl reasoners when to use sql queries to present the results in any way
in this paper we present a system they see fit
