The Semantic Webs need for machine understandable content has led researchers to attempt to automatically acquire The Semantic Webs
To date such research has focused on  documentdriven  systems
a small set of documents annotating each with respect to a given ontology
documentdriven  systems that individually process a small set of documents
an alternative that strives to more fully leverage
more fully leverage existing ontological content while scaling to extract comparatively shallow content from millions of documents
This paper introduces an alternative
This paper introduces OntoSyphon
OntoSyphon operates in an  ontologydriven  manner taking any ontology as input OntoSyphon uses the ontology to specify web searches relations
OntoSyphon operates in an  ontologydriven  manner taking any ontology as input OntoSyphon uses the ontology to specify web searches taxonomic information
manner taking any ontology as input OntoSyphon uses the ontology to specify web searches that identify possible semantic instances
Redundancy in The Semantic Webs together with information from the ontology is then used to automatically verify these candidate instances and relations enabling OntoSyphon to operate in a fully automated unsupervised manner
we present experimental results
A prototype of OntoSyphon is fully implemented
experimental results that demonstrate substantial instance learning in a variety of domains based on independently constructed ontologies
We also introduce new methods for improving instance verification
We also demonstrate that new methods improve upon previously known techniques
