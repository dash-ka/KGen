data on the semantic web is semistructured
data on the semantic web does not follow one
one fixed schema
faceted browsing is a natural technique for navigating such data partitioning the information space into orthogonal conceptual dimensions
current faceted interfaces have limited query expressiveness
current faceted interfaces are manually constructed
we formally show the improvement over existing interfaces
we develop an expressive faceted interface for semistructured data
secondly we develop metrics for automatic ranking of facet quality
metrics for automatic ranking of facet quality bypassing the need for manual construction of the interface
we develop rdf
experimental evaluation shows improved usability over current interfaces
