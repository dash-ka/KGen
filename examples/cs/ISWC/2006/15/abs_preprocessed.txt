this paper presents the provenance explorer
the data states and events associated with a scientific workflow in order to validate the results
using rdf visualizations this paper enables scientists to view the data states and events

initially the provenance explorer presents a simple coarsegrained view of the scientific process or experiment
however the provenance explorer allows permitted users to expand the system to reveal particular subevents inputs
