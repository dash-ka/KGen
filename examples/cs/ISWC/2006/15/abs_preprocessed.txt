This paper presents the Provenance Explorer
the data states and events associated with a scientific workflow in order to understand the scientific methodology
Using graph visualizations This paper enables scientists to view the data states and events
Using RDF visualizations This paper enables scientists to view the data states and events
the data states and events associated with a scientific workflow in order to validate the results
Initially the Provenance Explorer presents a simple coarsegrained view of the scientific process or experiment
However the Provenance Explorer allows permitted users to expand The system to reveal particular subevents inputs
However the Provenance Explorer allows permitted users to expand The system to reveal more finegrained information about particular subevents

Access control is implemented using Shibboleth to identify users to define access control policies
Access control is implemented using Shibboleth to identify XACML to define access control policies
Access control is implemented using Shibboleth to authenticate XACML to define access control policies
Access control is implemented using Shibboleth to authenticate users to define access control policies
The system also provides a platform for publishing scientific results
the visualized draganddrop select particular nodes into an RDF package for publication
the visualized workflow select particular nodes into an RDF package for publication
the visualized draganddrop select particular nodes into an RDF package for elearning
the visualized workflow select particular nodes into an RDF package for elearning
The system enables users to select particular nodes within the
the individual components selected for such packages
The direct relationships between the individual components are inferred by the ruleinference engine
