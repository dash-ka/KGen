the task of automatically composing web services involves two main composition processes
the task of automatically composing web services involves horizontal composition
the task of automatically composing web services involves vertical
vertical composition consists of defining an appropriate combination of simple processes to perform a composition task
horizontal composition process consists of determining the most appropriate web service from among a set of functionally equivalent ones for each component process
several recent research efforts have dealt with the web service composition problem
nevertheless most of several recent research efforts tackled only the vertical composition of web services despite the growing trend towards functionally equivalent web services
in an attempt to streamline the process of horizontal composition of web services while taking the above limitation into consideration this work includes two main contributions
in an attempt to facilitate this work includes two main contributions
the first is a generic formalization of any web service composition problem a generic formalization of any web service composition problem based on a constraint optimization problem lrb a constraint optimization problem rrb is compatible to any web service description language
any web service composition problem based on a constraint optimization problem
some predefined criteria at runtime
the second contribution is an incremental userinterventionbased protocol to find the optimal composite web service according to some
our goal is i  to deal with many crucial natural features of web services such as incomplete web service information etc and ii  to allow human user intervention to enhance the solving process
our goal is i  to deal with many crucial natural features of web services such as distributed environment etc and ii  to allow human user intervention to enhance the solving process
our goal is i  to deal with many crucial natural features of web services such as uncertain etc and ii  to allow human user intervention to enhance the solving process
our goal is i  to deal with many crucial natural features of web services such as dynamic etc and ii  to allow human user intervention to enhance the solving process
three approaches are described in this work a centralized approach
