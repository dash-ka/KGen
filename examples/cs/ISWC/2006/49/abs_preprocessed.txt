OWL ontologies present many interesting visualization challenges
Here we present a technique
Here we present CropCircles
a technique designed to view the class hierarchies in ontologies as trees
topology understanding when designing the tool
we place special emphasis on topology understanding
we drew inspiration from treemaps
we made substantial changes in the representation and layout
Most notably the spacefillingness of treemap is relaxed in exchange for visual clarity
we discuss the interface and implementation
the requirements that go into the design of the tool
we outline the problem scape of visualizing ontology hierarchies
we note the requirements
a controlled experiment involving tasks common to understanding ontologies
Finally through a controlled experiment we show the benefits of we design
