owl ontologies present many interesting visualization challenges
here we present cropcircles
here we present a technique
a technique designed to view the class hierarchies in ontologies as trees
topology understanding when designing the tool
we place special emphasis on topology understanding
we made substantial changes in the representation and layout
we drew inspiration from treemaps
most notably the spacefillingness of treemap is relaxed in exchange for visual clarity
we outline the problem scape of visualizing ontology hierarchies
the requirements that go into the design of the tool
we discuss the interface and implementation
we note the requirements
finally through a controlled experiment we show the benefits of we design
a controlled experiment involving tasks common to understanding ontologies
