We survey nearly 1300 OWL ontologies
We survey RDFS schemas
The collection of statistical data allows us to perform analysis
The collection of statistical data allows us to report some trends
Though most of the documents are syntactically OWL Full Full very few stay in OWL Full when most of the documents are syntactically patched by adding type triples
We also report the frequency of the shape of class hierarchies in the ontologies
We also report the frequency of occurrences of OWL language constructs
Finally We note that of the largest ontologies most do not exceed the description logic expressivity of ALC
