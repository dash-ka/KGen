the major difference between the two approaches is on the usage of  foreign terms  at the syntactic level

the domain disjointness assumption adopted by the linking approach
we investigation shows that the domain disjointness assumption leads to several semantic difficulties
we explore the possibility of avoiding some of these difficulties
these difficulties using the importing approach to linking ontology modules
