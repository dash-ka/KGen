The major difference between the two approaches is on the usage of  foreign terms  at the syntactic level
The major difference between the two approaches is on the usage of  foreign terms  on the local model disjointness at the semantic level
We compare the semantics of linking in Distributed Description Logics
We compare the semantics of importing in such as Distributed Description Logics RRB
We compare the semantics of importing in Packagebased Description Logics within the Distributed First Order Logics framework
We compare the semantics of importing in such as DDL RRB
We compare the semantics of importing in Econnections
We compare the semantics of linking in Econnections
We compare the semantics of importing in Modular ontology languages
the domain disjointness assumption adopted by the linking approach
We investigation shows that the domain disjointness assumption leads to several semantic difficulties
these difficulties using the importing approach to linking ontology modules
We explore the possibility of avoiding some of these difficulties
