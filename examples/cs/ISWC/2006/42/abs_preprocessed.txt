We claim that user preferences are a key component of Web service composition
a component that has largely been ignored
We claim that user preferences are a component
In this paper We propose a means of specifying user preferences into Web service composition
In this paper We propose a means of intergrating user preferences into Web service composition
To this end we propose a means of performing automated Web service composition by exploiting generic procedures together with rich qualitative user preferences
We exploit the agent programming language Golog to represent We generic procedures to represent rich qualitative temporal user preferences
We exploit the agent programming language Golog to represent We a firstorder preference language to represent rich qualitative temporal user preferences
From these We generate Web service compositions
Web service compositions that realize the generic procedure satisfying the users hard constraints
Web service compositions that realize the generic procedure optimizing for the users preferences
We prove We approach sound
We prove We approach optimal
We system GologPref is interacting with services on the Web
We system GologPref is implemented
The language and techniques proposed in this paper
The language and techniques can be integrated into a variety of approaches to Web
The language and techniques can be integrated into a variety of approaches to Grid service composition
