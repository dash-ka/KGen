the worstcase which is a serious problem
reasoning on owl ontologies is known to be intractable in the worstcase because numerous assertions about individuals relations
reasoning on owl ontologies is known to be intractable in the worstcase because numerous assertions about individuals relations
reasoning on owl ontologies is known to be intractable in the worstcase because in practice most owl ontologies have large aboxes
we propose a technique
a technique that uses a summary of the ontology  to reduce reasoning to a small subset of the original abox
a technique that uses a summary of summary abox  to reduce reasoning to a small subset of the original abox
a technique that prove that we techniques are complete
a technique that prove that we techniques are sound
4 ontologies the largest of which has 65 million role assertions
we demonstrate the scalability of this technique for consistency detection in 4 ontologies
