Social networks have recently garnered considerable interest
With the intention of utilizing social networks for the Semantic Web several studies have examined automatic extraction of social networks
However most methods have addressed extraction of the strength of relations
Our goal is extracting the underlying relations between entities
entities that are embedded in social networks
To this end Our propose The proposed method
Fundamentally the method clusters similar entity pairs according to the method clusters collective contexts in Web documents
The descriptive labels for relations are obtained from results of clustering
The proposed method is entirely unsupervised
The proposed method is easily incorporated into existing social network extraction methods
The proposed method also contributes to ontology population by elucidating relations between instances in social networks
Our experiments achieved clustering with high precision and recall
Our experiments conducted on the entities
Our extracted appropriate relation labels to represent the entities
