Ontology mapping plays an important role in bridging the semantic gap between heterogeneous data sources
Ontology mapping plays an important role in bridging the semantic gap between distributed data sources
As the Semantic Web slowly becomes the amount of online semantic data increases a new generation of tools is developed that automatically integrate this data
As the Semantic Web slowly becomes real amount of online semantic data increases a new generation of tools is developed that automatically find this data

As the Semantic Web slowly becomes the amount of online semantic data increases a new generation of tools is developed that automatically find this data
Unlike in the case of these new tools these new tools require mapping techniques
techniques that can be performed at run time
The contribution of this paper is twofold
run time mapping techniques
First we investigate the general requirements for run time
algorithm that was designed to be used at runtime by an ontology
an ontology based question answering tool
Second we describe we PowerMap mapping algorithm
