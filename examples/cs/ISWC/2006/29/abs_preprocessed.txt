as the semantic web slowly becomes real amount of online semantic data increases a new generation of tools is developed that automatically integrate this data

unlike in the case of these new tools these new tools require mapping techniques
techniques that can be performed at run time
the contribution of this paper is twofold
run time mapping techniques
first we investigate the general requirements for run time
second we describe we powermap mapping algorithm
an ontology based question answering tool
algorithm that was designed to be used at runtime by an ontology
