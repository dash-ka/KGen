however each tool currently relies on each tool own ad vocabulary for specifying core rdf presentation knowledge making it difficult to reuse such knowledge across applications
however each tool currently relies on each tool own ad hoc mechanisms
however each tool currently relies on each tool own ad vocabulary for specifying core rdf presentation knowledge making it difficult to share such knowledge across applications
recognizing the general need for presenting core rdf content to users we designed fresnel as a browserindependent vocabulary of core rdf display concepts
wanting to promote the exchange of presentation knowledge we designed fresnel as a browserindependent vocabulary of core rdf display concepts
in this paper we describe fresnels main concepts several rdf browsers
in this paper we describe visualization tools
visualization tools that have adopted the vocabulary so far
in this paper we describe fresnels main present several rdf browsers
