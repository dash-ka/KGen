an ontology using the rules
a common approach for reasoning is to work on the closure at query time
the rules specified
a common approach for reasoning is to compute the deductive closure of an ontology
a common approach for reasoning increases the space requirements
a common approach for reasoning reduces the run time complexity
the main reason of this increase is the type statements in the ontology
the main reason of this increase is the subclass statements in the ontology
type statements show a significant percentage in most ontologies
particular type statements relying on this increase
since subclass is a transitive property derivation of other statements in particular type statements gives rise to cyclic repetition
since subclass is a transitive property derivation of other statements in particular type statements gives rise to an excess of inferred type statements
in brief a major part of closure computation is deriving the type statements
the type statements relying on subclass statements
in this paper we propose a syntactic transformation
a syntactic transformation that is based on novel individual grouping constructs
inferred type statements relying on subclass relations
a syntactic transformation that is based on novel individual grouping constructs
a syntactic transformation reduces the number of inferred type statements
thus the space requirement of reasoning is reduced without affecting the soundness
thus the space requirement of reasoning is reduced without affecting the completeness
