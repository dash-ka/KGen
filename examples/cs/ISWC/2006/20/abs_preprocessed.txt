in this paper we show how to use ontologies to bootstrap a knowledge acquisition process
a knowledge acquisition process that extracts product information from tabular data on web pages
furthermore we use logical rules to to derive higherorder knowledge about product features
furthermore we use logical rules to reason about product specific properties
the knowledge acquisition process covering both procedural aspects
we will also explain the knowledge acquisition process
the knowledge acquisition process covering both ontological aspects
finally we will give an quantitative evaluation of we results
finally we will give an qualitative evaluation of we results
