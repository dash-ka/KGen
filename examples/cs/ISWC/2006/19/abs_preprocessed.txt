facet browsing has become popular as a user friendly interface to data repositories
the semantic web raises new challenges due to the heterogeneous character of the data
first users should be able to make selections based on properties of other semantically related types
first users should be able to select through facets of resources of any type
first users should be able to navigate through facets of resources of any type
second where traditional facet browsers require manual configuration of the software a semantic web browser should be able to handle any rdfs dataset without any additional configuration
third hierarchical data on the semantic web is not designed for browsing complementary techniques such as search should be available to overcome this problem
we address these requirements in we browser facet
the hierarchical navigation that characterizes current facet browsing
additionally the interface allows the inclusion of facetspecific display options
facetspecific display options that go beyond the hierarchical navigation
facet is a tool for the semantic web developers as an instant interface to the semantic web complete dataset
the automatic facet configuration can then be further
the automatic facet configuration generated by the system
further refined to configure the system as a tool for end users
the implementation is based on current web standards
the implementation is based on open source software
the new functionality is motivated using a scenario from the cultural heritage domain
