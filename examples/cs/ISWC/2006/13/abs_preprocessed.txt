this paper presents an approach for visually modeling owl dl and owl full ontologies based on the wellestablished visual modeling language uml
we discuss a metamodel for owl
owl based on the metaobject facility
we discuss transformations between both
we discuss an associated uml profile as visual syntax
the work we present supports modeldriven development of owl ontologies
the work we present is currently undergoing the standardization process of the object management group
the implementation of we approach showing how the uml profile can be used to improve developing semantic web applications
the implementation of an example showing how the uml profile can be used to improve developing semantic web applications
the implementation of an example showing how the metamodel profile can be used to improve developing semantic web applications
after describing we approach we present the implementation of an example
after describing we approach we present the implementation of we approach
the implementation of we approach showing how the metamodel profile can be used to improve developing semantic web applications
