in a semantic environment data is described by ontologies
heterogeneity problems have to be solved at the ontological level
this means that alignments between ontologies have to be created most probably during designtime
this means that alignments between ontologies have to be used in various runtime processes
such alignments describe a set of mappings between the target ontologies where the mappings show how instance data from one ontology can be expressed in terms of another ontology
such alignments describe a set of mappings between the source ontologies where the mappings show how instance data from one ontology can be expressed in terms of another ontology
we propose a formal model for mapping creation
starting from a formal model we explore how such a model maps onto a designtime graphical tool
a designtime graphical tool that can be used in creating alignments between ontologies
we also investigate how such a model helps in expressing the mappings in a logical language based on the semantic relationships
the semantic relationships identified using the graphical tool
