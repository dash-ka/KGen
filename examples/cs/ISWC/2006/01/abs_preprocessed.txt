the relations holding between two ontologies
An ontology alignment explicitly describes the relations
A system is herein called a distributed system
A system composed of alignments interconnecting A system
A system composed of alignments interconnecting them
A system composed of ontologies interconnecting them
A system composed of ontologies interconnecting A system
We give three different semantics of a distributed system
a distributed system that do not interfere with the semantics of ontologies
A system are compared with respect to allowing consistent merge of ontologies
A system are compared with respect to complying with an alignment composition operation
A system composed of ontologies interconnecting them advantages
A system composed of alignments interconnecting them advantages
A system are compared with respect to managing heterogeneity
We show that only the first two variants can offer a sound composition operation
only the first two variants which differ from other proposed semantics
