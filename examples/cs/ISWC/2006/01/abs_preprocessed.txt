an ontology alignment explicitly describes the relations
the relations holding between two ontologies
a system composed of ontologies interconnecting them
a system composed of ontologies interconnecting a system
a system composed of alignments interconnecting a system
a system is herein called a distributed system
a system composed of alignments interconnecting them
we give three different semantics of a distributed system
a distributed system that do not interfere with the semantics of ontologies
a system composed of ontologies interconnecting them advantages
a system are compared with respect to allowing consistent merge of ontologies
a system are compared with respect to managing heterogeneity
a system composed of alignments interconnecting them advantages
a system are compared with respect to complying with an alignment composition operation
we show that only the first two variants can offer a sound composition operation
only the first two variants which differ from other proposed semantics
