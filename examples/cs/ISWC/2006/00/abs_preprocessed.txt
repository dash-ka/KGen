ontology search and reuse is becoming increasingly important as the quest for methods to reduce the cost of constructing such knowledge structures continues
a number of search engines are coming to existence to facilitate locating potentially relevant ontologies
a number of ontology libraries are coming to existence to facilitate retrieving potentially relevant ontologies
a number of search engines are coming to existence to facilitate retrieving potentially relevant ontologies
a number of ontology libraries are coming to existence to facilitate locating potentially relevant ontologies
a number of ontology libraries is steadily growing
a number of ontology libraries so is the need for methods to evaluate and rank existing ontologies in terms of a number of search engines relevance to the needs of the knowledge engineer
