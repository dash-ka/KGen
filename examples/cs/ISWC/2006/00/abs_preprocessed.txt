Ontology search and reuse is becoming increasingly important as the quest for methods to reduce the cost of constructing such knowledge structures continues
A number of search engines are coming to existence to facilitate retrieving potentially relevant ontologies
A number of search engines are coming to existence to facilitate locating potentially relevant ontologies
A number of ontology libraries are coming to existence to facilitate locating potentially relevant ontologies
A number of ontology libraries are coming to existence to facilitate retrieving potentially relevant ontologies
A number of search engines so is the need for methods to evaluate and rank existing ontologies in terms of A number of search engines relevance to the needs of the knowledge engineer

This paper presents a prototype system for ranking ontologies
ranking ontologies based on a number of structural metrics
