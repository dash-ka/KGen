data satisfying query conditions with varying degrees of exactness
we explore flexible querying of rdf data with the aim of making it possible to rank the results of a query depending on how  closely  a query satisfy the query conditions
we explore flexible querying of rdf data with the aim of making it possible to return data
we make queries more flexible by logical relaxation of a query conditions based on rdfs ontologies
we make queries more flexible by logical relaxation of a query conditions based on rdfs entailment
we develop a notion of ranking of query answers
we present a query processing algorithm for incrementally computing the relaxed answer of a query
scenarios where there is a lack of understanding of the ontology
the ontology underlying the data
we approach has application in scenarios
we approach where the data objects have heterogeneous sets of irregular structures
we approach where the data objects have heterogeneous sets of properties
