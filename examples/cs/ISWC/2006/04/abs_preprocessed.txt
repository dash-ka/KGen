an approach that unifies browsing by visual features for intuitive exploration of image databases
an approach that unifies browsing by tags for intuitive exploration of image databases
We propose an approach
collaborative tagging sites complemented by simple image analysis
In contrast to traditional image retrieval approaches we utilise tags provided by users on collaborative tagging sites
collaborative tagging sites complemented by classification
This allows us to find new relations between data elements
We introduce the concept of a navigation map
a navigation map that describes links between tags
a navigation map that describes links between users
a navigation map that describes links between data elements for the example of the collaborative tagging site Flickr
We show that introducing similarity search based on image features yields additional links on this map
We system using data from real the collaborative tagging site Flickr users
These theoretical considerations are supported by examples
