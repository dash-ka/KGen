Wireless connectivity of portable devices offer novel opportunities for users to share resources anytime
widespread diffusion of portable devices offer novel opportunities for users to form adhoc coalitions
Resource access control is crucial to leverage these adhoc collaborations
resource availability frequently varies even unpredictably due to userdevice mobility thus complicating resource access control
In pervasive scenarios
however
collaborating entities can not be predetermined
Access control policies can not be specified a priori to face any operative run time condition
Access control policies can not be defined based on entitys identitiesroles as in traditional access control solutions
Access control policies require continuous adjustments to adapt to the current situation
To address these issues this paper advocates semantic technologies for contextpolicy specification to allow highlevel description and reasoning about context
To address these issues this paper advocates contextawareness to enable dynamic adaptation of policies depending on context changes
To address these issues this paper advocates contextawareness to control resource access on the basis of context visibility
To address these issues this paper advocates semantic technologies for contextpolicy specification to allow highlevel description and reasoning about policies
novel access control policy models that follow two main design guidelines
To address these issues this paper advocates the adoption of novel access control policy models
a semantic contextaware policy model that adopts rules to express context
this paper also describes the design of a semantic contextaware policy model
a semantic contextaware policy model that adopts ontologies to express contextaware access control policies
a semantic contextaware policy model that adopts rules to express contextaware access control policies
a semantic contextaware policy model that supports policy adaptation
a semantic contextaware policy model that adopts ontologies to express context
