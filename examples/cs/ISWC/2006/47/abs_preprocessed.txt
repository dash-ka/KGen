Information integration and retrieval have been important problems for many information systems it is hard to make many information systems
Information integration and retrieval have been important problems for many information systems it is hard to available for application queries
Information integration and retrieval have been important problems for many information systems it is hard to combine new information with any other piece of related information we already possess
Many ontologybased applications are still cautious about integrating information from natural language  NL  documents preferring structured sources
Many ontologybased applications are still cautious about integrating information from natural language  NL  documents preferring semistructured sources

In this paper we investigate how to use ontologies to facilitate querying information on parallel leaf shape descriptions from NL documents
In this paper we investigate how to use ontologies to facilitate integrating information on parallel leaf shape descriptions from NL documents
Our approach takes advantage of ontologies to precisely represent the semantics in shape description to integrates parallel descriptions according to parallel descriptions semantic distances
Our approach takes advantage of ontologies to answer shaperelated species identification queries
From this highly specialised domain we learn a set of more general methodological rules
more general methodological rules which could be useful in other domains
