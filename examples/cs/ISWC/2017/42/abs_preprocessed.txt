Crosslingual taxonomy alignment refers to mapping each category in the source taxonomy of one language onto a ranked list of most relevant categories in the target taxonomy of another language
Recently vector similarities depending on bilingual topic models have achieved the stateoftheart performance on Crosslingual taxonomy alignment
However bilingual topic models ignore explicit category correlations such as the categories among the categories of ancestordescendant relationships in a taxonomy
the categories cooccurring words in text
However bilingual topic models only model the textual context of categories
the categories cooccurring words in correlations
However bilingual topic models ignore explicit category correlations such as correlations between the categories among the categories of ancestordescendant relationships in a taxonomy
Crosslingual taxonomy alignment which brings two novel category correlation based CCBiBTM
Crosslingual taxonomy alignment which brings two novel category correlation based called CCBiLDA
Crosslingual taxonomy alignment which brings two novel category correlation based bilingual topic models
In this paper we propose a unified solution to encode category correlations into bilingual topic modeling for Crosslingual taxonomy alignment
Experiments on two realworld datasets show our proposed models significantly outperform the stateoftheart baselines on Crosslingual taxonomy at least 109 percent in each evaluation metric
