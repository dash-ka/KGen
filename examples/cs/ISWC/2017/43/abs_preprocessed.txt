8 effective features for cross lingual infobox attribute matching containing categories templates attribute labels
In this paper we propose 8 effective features for cross lingual infobox attribute matching
8 effective features for cross lingual infobox attribute matching containing categories templates attribute values
We propose entityattribute factor graph to consider not only individual features
We propose entityattribute factor graph to consider not only the correlations among attribute pairs
