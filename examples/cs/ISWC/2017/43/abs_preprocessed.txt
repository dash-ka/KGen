wikipedia infoboxes are thus a very rich source of structured knowledge
wikipedia infoboxes contain information about article entities in the form of attributevalue pairs
however as the different language versions of wikipedia evolve independently it is a challenging problem to find correspondences between infobox attributes in different language editions

8 effective features for cross lingual infobox attribute matching containing categories templates attribute values
8 effective features for cross lingual infobox attribute matching containing categories templates attribute labels
in this paper we propose 8 effective features for cross lingual infobox attribute matching
we propose entityattribute factor graph to consider not only individual features
we propose entityattribute factor graph to consider not only the correlations among attribute pairs
