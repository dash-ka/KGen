Ontology alignment is an area of active research where many algorithms and approaches are being developed
many algorithms is usually evaluated by comparing the produced alignments to a reference alignment in terms of recall
approaches performance is usually evaluated by comparing the produced alignments to a reference alignment in terms of Fmeasure
approaches performance is usually evaluated by comparing the produced alignments to a reference alignment in terms of precision

These measures however do not reveal differences between alignments at a finergrained level such as
These measures however do not reveal individual mappings
These measures however only provide an overall assessment of the quality of the alignments
These measures however do not reveal commonalities between alignments at a finergrained level such as
These measures however do not reveal regions
Furthermore reference alignments are often unavailable which makes the comparative exploration of alignments at different levels of granularity even more important
Making such comparisons efficient calls for a  humanintheloop  approach best supported through interactive visual representations of alignments
Our approach extends Matrix Cubes used for visualizing dense dynamic networks
Our approach extends a recent tool  used for visualizing dense dynamic networks
Our first identify use cases for ontology alignment evaluation
then detail how Our Alignment Cubes support interactive exploration of multiple ontology alignments
ontology alignment evaluation that can benefit from interactive visualization
Our demonstrate the usefulness of Alignment Cubes by describing visual exploration scenarios showing how Alignment Cubes support common tasks
support common tasks identified in the use cases
