Automated acquisition of ontologies from data has attracted research interest because Automated acquisition LRB Automated acquisition RRB of ontologies from data can complement manual expensive construction of ontologies
We investigate the problem of General Terminology Induction in OWL ie
the problem of General Terminology Induction in OWL ie acquiring general expressive TBox axioms from data 
the problem of General Terminology Induction in OWL ie acquiring general expressive TBox axioms from an ABox 
We define novel measures
novel measures designed to rigorously evaluate the quality of general expressive TBox axioms while respecting the standard semantics of OWL
We propose an informed datadriven algorithm that constructs class expressions for general expressive TBox axioms in guarantees completeness
We propose an informed datadriven algorithm that constructs class expressions for general expressive TBox axioms in OWL completeness
We empirically evaluate the quality measures on two corpora of ontologies and run a case study with a domain expert to gain insight into applicability of the measures and acquired general expressive TBox axioms
The results show that the measures capture different quality aspects
only correct general expressive TBox axioms can be interesting
