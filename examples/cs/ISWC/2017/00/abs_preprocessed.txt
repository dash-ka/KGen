a growing number of highly optimized reasoning algorithms have been developed to allow inference tasks on expressive ontology languages such as owl
nevertheless there is broad agreement that a reasoner could be optimized for some
nevertheless there is broad agreement that a reasoner could be optimized for all the ontologies
this particular fact makes it hard to select the best performing reasoner to handle a given ontology especially for novice users
in this paper we present our introduced ranking method
we generates a recommendation in the form of reasoner ranking
the efficiency as well as the correctness are our main ranking criteria
our solution combines and adjusts multitarget regression techniques
our solution combines and adjusts multilabel classification
a large collection of 10 wellknown reasoners are studied
a large collection of ontologies are studied
the experimental results show that our introduced ranking method performs significantly better than several stateoftheart ranking solutions
furthermore the experimental results proves that our introduced ranking method could effectively be evolved to a competitive metareasoner
