Realtime processing of data streams is becoming a common task in Internet of Things scenarios
data streams emanating from sensors
The key implementation goal consists supporting advanced data analytics services like anomaly detection
The key implementation goal consists in efficiently handling massive incoming data streams
In an ongoing industrial project a 24 7 available stream processing engine usually faces dynamically changing workload characteristics
In an ongoing industrial project a 24 7 available stream processing engine usually faces dynamically changing data
These changes impact a 24 7 available stream processing engine usually performance
These changes impact a 24 7 available stream processing engine usually reliability
We propose a hybrid adaptive distributed RDF Stream Processing engine
Stream Processing engine that optimizes logical query plan according to the state of data streams
We propose Strider
a hybrid adaptive distributed RDF Stream Processing engine has been designed to guarantee important industrial properties such as high throughput
Strider has been designed to guarantee important industrial properties such as high availability

We highlight the efficiency  of Strider on realworld sets
We highlight eg on a single machine machine up to 60x gain on throughput compared to a throughput of 31 million triplessecond on a 9 machines cluster a major breakthrough in this systems category  of Strider on synthetic data sets
