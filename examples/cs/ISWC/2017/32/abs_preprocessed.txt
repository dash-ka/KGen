data streams emanating from sensors
realtime processing of data streams is becoming a common task in internet of things scenarios
the key implementation goal consists supporting advanced data analytics services like anomaly detection
the key implementation goal consists in efficiently handling massive incoming data streams
in an ongoing industrial project a 24 7 available stream processing engine usually faces dynamically changing data
in an ongoing industrial project a 24 7 available stream processing engine usually faces dynamically changing workload characteristics
these changes impact a 24 7 available stream processing engine usually performance
these changes impact a 24 7 available stream processing engine usually reliability
we propose strider
stream processing engine that optimizes logical query plan according to the state of data streams
we propose a hybrid adaptive distributed rdf stream processing engine
strider has been designed to guarantee important industrial properties such as high throughput
