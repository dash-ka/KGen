SPARQL query answering in ontologybased data access is carried out by translating into SQL queries over the data source
Standard translation techniques try to transform the user query into a union of conjunctive queries following the heuristic argument that UCQs can be efficiently evaluated by modern relational database engines
In this work we show that translating to UCQs is not always the best choice
In this work we show that under certain conditions on the interplay between the statistics of the data alternative translations can be evaluated much more efficiently
In this work we show that under certain conditions on the interplay between the ontology alternative translations can be evaluated much more efficiently
In this work we show that under certain conditions on the interplay between the mappings alternative translations can be evaluated much more efficiently
a novel cardinality estimation that takes into account all such SPARQL query answering in ontologybased data access components
To find the best translation we devise a cost model together with a novel cardinality estimation
we experiments confirm that alternatives to the best translation might produce queries is faithful to the actual query evaluation cost
queries that are orders of magnitude the cost model we propose
we experiments confirm that alternatives to the best translation might produce hence is well suited to select the best translation
queries that are orders of magnitude more efficient
