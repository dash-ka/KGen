the disjunctive skolem chase is a sound
the disjunctive skolem chase is complete  algorithm that can be used to solve conjunctive query answering over dl ontologies and programs with disjunctive existential rules
the disjunctive skolem chase is albeit nonterminating  algorithm that can be used to solve conjunctive query answering over dl ontologies and programs with disjunctive existential rules
even though acyclicity notions can be used to ensure chase termination for a large subset of realworld knowledge bases the complexity of reasoning over acyclic theories still remains high
hence we study these general restrictions
we include an evaluation
an evaluation that shows that almost all acyclic dl ontologies do indeed satisfy these general restrictions
