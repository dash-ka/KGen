the SPARQL language that allows appending a  PREFER  clause
In this paper we present SPREFQL an extension of the SPARQL language  soft  preferences over the query results obtained by the main body of the query
PREFER  clause that expresses
an extension of the SPARQL language does not add expressivity
any SPREFQL query can be transformed to an equivalent standard SPARQL query
the SPARQL language that allows appending a  PREFER  clause
a  PREFER  clause that expresses  soft  preferences over the query
However clearly separating preferences from the  hard  patterns  WHERE  clause gives queries where the intention of the client is more cleanly expressed an advantage for both machine optimization
However clearly separating preferences from the  filters in the  WHERE  clause gives queries where the intention of the client is more cleanly expressed an advantage for both human readability

the SPARQL language that allows appending a  PREFER  clause
In this paper we present SPREFQL we formally define the syntax
In this paper we present SPREFQL we formally define the semantics of an extension of the SPARQL language
a  PREFER  clause that expresses  soft  preferences over the query
we also provide empirical evidence that optimizations specific to SPREFQL improve runtime efficiency by comparison to the usually applied optimizations on the equivalent standard SPARQL query
