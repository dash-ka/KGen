the idea to execute queries over several distributed knowledge bases lies at the core of the semantic web vision
federated querying  lies at the core of the semantic web vision
the service keyword that allows one to allocate subqueries to servers
to accommodate the semantic web vision sparql provides the service keyword
multiple sources resulting in a combinatorially growing number of alternative allocations of subqueries to sources
in many cases however data may be available from multiple sources
running a federated query on all possible sources might not be very lucrative from a users point of view if extensive execution times or fees are involved in accessing all possible sources data
this shortcoming federated joincardinality approximation techniques
to address this shortcoming have been proposed to narrow down the number of possible allocations to a few most promising  ones
