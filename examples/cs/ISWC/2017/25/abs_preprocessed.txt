further adoption of these techniques however was probably hindered by the fact that nanopublications can lead to an explosion in the number of triples due to auxiliary information about the structure of each nanopublication
further adoption of these techniques however was probably hindered by the fact that nanopublications can lead to an explosion in the number of triples due to auxiliary information about the structure of repetitive provenance and metadata
we demonstrate here that this significant overhead disappears once we take the version history of nanopublication datasets into account calculate incremental updates
we demonstrate here that this significant overhead disappears once we allow users to deal with the specific subsets users need
typical subsets that researchers use for the total size and overhead of evolving scientific datasets analyses
typical subsets can be retrieved efficiently with optimized precision
typical subsets can be referenced efficiently with optimized reliability
typical subsets can be retrieved efficiently with optimized reliability
typical subsets can be referenced efficiently with optimized persistence

we show that the total size and overhead of evolving scientific datasets is reduced
