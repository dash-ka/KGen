Linked Data when servers provide different interfaces to access servers data
LDF  framework has been proposed as a uniform view to explore the tradeoffs of consuming Linked Data
The Linked Data Fragment  framework has been proposed as a uniform view to explore the tradeoffs of consuming Linked Data
this new LDF interface has this new LDF interface own particular properties regarding performance bandwidth needs arise
performance bandwidth needs caching Several practical challenges
For example before exposing a new type of LDFs in some server can we formally say something about how this new LDF interface compares to other interfaces previously implemented in the same server
From the client side given a client with some restricted capabilities in terms of time constraints which is the best type of LDFs to complete a given task
From the client side given a client with some restricted capabilities in terms of network connection which is the best type of LDFs to complete a given task
From the client side given a client with some restricted capabilities in terms of computational power which is the best type of LDFs to complete a given task
Today there are only a few formal theoretical tools to help answer these
