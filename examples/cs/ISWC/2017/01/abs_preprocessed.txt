owl is recognized as the de facto standard notation for ontology engineering
it is believed to be more effective for users
the manchester owl syntax was developed as an alternative to symbolic description logic
this paper sets out to test that belief from two perspectives by evaluating how accurately and quickly people understand the informational content of axioms
this paper sets out to derive inferences from people
by conducting a betweengroup empirical study involving 60 novice participants we found that symbolic description logic is just as effective as the manchester owl syntax for peoples understanding of axioms
moreover for two types of inference problems symbolic description logic supported significantly better task performance than the manchester owl syntax yet the manchester owl syntax never significantly outperformed symbolic description logic
these surprising results suggest that the belief that the manchester owl syntax is more effective than symbolic description logic at least for these types of task is unfounded
an outcome of this research is the suggestion that ontology axioms may be better presented in the manchester owl syntax
an outcome of this research is the suggestion that ontology axioms may be better presented in symbolic description logic
ontology axioms when presented to nonexperts
further empirical studies are needed to see whether further empirical studies hold for other types of task
further empirical studies are needed to explain these surprising results
