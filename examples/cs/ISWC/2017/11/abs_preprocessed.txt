Vector space embeddings have been shown to perform well when using RDF data in data machine learning tasks
Vector space embeddings have been shown to perform well when using RDF data in data mining
local sequences generated for nodes in the RDF graph
Existing approaches use local information rely on local sequences
Existing approaches such as RDF2Vec use local information rely on local sequences
For word embeddings global techniques such as GloVe have been proposed as an alternative
In this paper we show that the results are competitive with traditional local techniques like RDF2Vec
In this paper we show how the idea of global embeddings can be transferred to RDF embeddings
