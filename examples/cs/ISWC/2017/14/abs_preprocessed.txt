the present paper explores whether authoring tests accurately represent the expectations of ontology authors
authoring tests derived from competency questions
in earlier work we proposed that an ontology authoring interface can be improved by allowing the interface to test whether a given competency question is able to be answered by the ontology at a given stage of the interface to test whether cq rrb is able to be answered by the ontology at a given stage of cq rrb construction

an approach known as cqdriven ontology authorings understanding of cqs matches users understanding quite well especially for inexperienced ontology authors
