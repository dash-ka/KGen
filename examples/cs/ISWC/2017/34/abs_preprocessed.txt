Faceted search is the de facto approach for exploration of data in ecommerce the de facto approach for exploration of data in ecommerce allows users to construct queries in an intuitive way without a prior knowledge of formal query languages
the de facto approach for exploration of data in ecommerce has been recently adapted to the context of RDF
Existing faceted search systems however do not allow users to construct queries with recursion
Existing faceted search systems however do not allow users to construct queries with aggregation
aggregation which poses limitations in practice
recursion which poses limitations in practice
In this work we extend faceted search over RDF with these functionalities
In this work we study the corresponding query language
In particular we investigate complexity of query containment problems
In particular we investigate complexity of the query answering
