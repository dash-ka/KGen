the existing standards dedicated to querying
a dedicated programming language enabling Semantic Web programmers to directly define functions on RDF terms
the existing standards dedicated to representation
In addition to the existing standards Semantic Web programmers could really benefit from a dedicated programming language
a dedicated programming language enabling Semantic Web programmers to directly define functions on RDF graphs
a dedicated programming language enabling Semantic Web programmers to directly define functions on SPARQL results
This is especially the case for instance
instance when defining SPARQL extension functions
The ability to reuse dedicated aggregates are real cases
real cases where a dedicated language can support maintenance of the code
The ability to capitalize complex SPARQL filter expressions into extension functions are real cases
real cases where a dedicated language can support modularity of the code
The ability to define dedicated aggregates are real cases
functions assigned to RDFS classes with the selection of the function to be applied to a resource depending on the type of a resource
functional properties associated to the definition of procedural attachments as functions
functions assigned to OWL classes with the selection of the function to be applied to a resource depending on the type of a resource
functional properties associated to RDF resources as functions
Other families of use cases include the definition of functional properties
To address these needs we define a Linked Data script language on top of the SPARQL filter expression language
To address these needs we define LDScript 
We provide the formal grammar of the syntax inference rules of the semantics of the language
We provide the formal grammar of the Natural Semantics inference rules of the semantics of the language
an evaluation using real test bases from W3C
different implementations and approaches comparing in script interpretation
different implementations and approaches comparing in Java compilation
different implementations and approaches comparing in particular
We also provide a benchmark and perform an evaluation with different implementations and approaches
