This paper investigates meta structures schemalevel graphs that abstract connectivity information among a set of entities in a knowledge graph
knowledge discovery tasks ranging from relatedness explanation to data retrieval
Meta structures are useful in a variety of knowledge discovery tasks
We formalize the meta structure computation problem
We devise efficient automatabased algorithms
We introduce a meta structurebased relevance measure
a meta structurebased relevance measure which can retrieve entities related to those in input
We implemented We machineries in a visual tool
a visual tool called MEKoNG
We report on an extensive experimental evaluation
an extensive experimental evaluation which confirms the suitability of We proposal from both effectiveness point of view
