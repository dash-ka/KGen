this paper investigates meta structures schemalevel graphs that abstract connectivity information among a set of entities in a knowledge graph
knowledge discovery tasks ranging from relatedness explanation to data retrieval
meta structures are useful in a variety of knowledge discovery tasks
we devise efficient automatabased algorithms
we formalize the meta structure computation problem
we introduce a meta structurebased relevance measure
a meta structurebased relevance measure which can retrieve entities related to those in input
we implemented we machineries in a visual tool
a visual tool called mekong
we report on an extensive experimental evaluation
an extensive experimental evaluation which confirms the suitability of we proposal from both the efficiency of view
an extensive experimental evaluation which confirms the suitability of we proposal from both effectiveness point of view
