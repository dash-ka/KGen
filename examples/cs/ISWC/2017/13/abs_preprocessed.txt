Ontologybased Data Access is gaining importance both practically
Ontologybased Data Access is gaining importance both scientifically
However little attention has been paid so far to the problem of updating Ontologybased Data Access systems
This is an essential issue if we want to be able to cope with modifications of data both at the ontology and at the source level while maintaining the independence of the data sources
In this paper we propose mechanisms to properly handle updates in this context
we show that updating data both at the ontology level is firstorder rewritable
we show that updating data both at the source level is firstorder rewritable
we also provide a practical implementation of such
such updating mechanisms based on nonrecursive Datalog
