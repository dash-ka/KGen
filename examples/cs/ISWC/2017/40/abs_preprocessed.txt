huge text corpora which capture word embeddings distributional semantics
the relational knowledge captured in knowledge graph
a shared latent representation that integrates information across those modalities
we investigate the potential of complementing the relational knowledge embeddings with knowledge from text documents and images by learning a shared latent representation
we empirical results show that a joined concept representation provides measurable benefits for semantic similarity benchmarks since a joined concept representation shows a higher correlation with the human notion of similarity than uni or bimodal representations and entitytype prediction tasks since a joined concept representation clearly outperforms plain knowledge graph embeddings
knowledge that go beyond todays knowledge graphs
these findings encourage further research towards capturing types of knowledge
