Recent approaches encode such knowledge by learning latent representations  separately In computer vision visual object features are learned from large image collections
huge text corpora which capture word embeddings distributional semantics

We investigate the potential of complementing the relational knowledge embeddings with knowledge from text documents and images by learning a shared latent representation
a shared latent representation that integrates information across those modalities
the relational knowledge captured in Knowledge Graph
We empirical results show that a joined concept representation provides measurable benefits for semantic similarity benchmarks since a joined concept representation shows a higher correlation with the human notion of similarity than uni or bimodal representations and entitytype prediction tasks since a joined concept representation clearly outperforms plain Knowledge Graph embeddings
knowledge that go beyond todays Knowledge Graphs
These findings encourage further research towards capturing types of knowledge
