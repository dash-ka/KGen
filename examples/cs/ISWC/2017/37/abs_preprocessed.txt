Privacy audit logs are used to capture the actions of participants in a data sharing environment in order for auditors to check compliance with privacy policies
However collusion may occur between the auditors and participants to obfuscate actions
actions that should be recorded in Privacy audit logs
tamperproof audit logs that provide proof of log manipulation and nonrepudiation
In this paper we propose a Linked Data
a Linked Data based method of utilizing blockchain technology to create tamperproof audit logs
we also provide experimental validation of the scalability of we solution using an existing Linked Data privacy audit log model
