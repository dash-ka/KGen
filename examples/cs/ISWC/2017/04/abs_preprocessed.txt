The Web of Data is an inherently distributed environment where ontologies are subject to constant changes
The Web of Data is an inherently distributed environment where ontologies are located in remote locations
Reasoning is affected by constant changes
the extent and significance of this dependency is not wellstudied yet
To address this problem this paper presents an empirical study on how the distribution of ontological data on The Web of Data affects the outcome of reasoning
We study to what extent the inclusion of additional ontological information via IRI dereferencing leads to new derivations
We study to what extent the inclusion of the owl leads to new derivations
We study to what degree datasets depend on external ontologies
We study to what extent the inclusion of imports directive to the input datasets leads to new derivations
