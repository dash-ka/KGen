jeuxdemots is a rich collaborative lexical network in french represented in an adhoc tabular format
french built on a crowdsourcing principle as a game with a purpose
in the interest of interoperability we propose a conversion algorithm for jeuxdemots following the ontolex model along with a word sense alignment algorithm anchors jeuxdemots senserefinements to synsets in the lemon edition of babelnet
a word sense alignment algorithm called jdmbabelizer that
in the interest of reuse we propose a conversion algorithm for jeuxdemots following the ontolex model along with a word sense alignment algorithm anchors jeuxdemots senserefinements to the linguistic linked open data cloud

our produce a reference alignment dataset for jeuxdemots that our use to evaluate the quality of a conversion algorithm for jeuxdemots following the ontolex model along with a word sense alignment algorithm
