the most relevant knowledge contained in large ontologies
ensuring access to the most relevant knowledge has been identified as an important challenge
subontologies that preserve all entailments over a given vocabulary
to this end subontologies  have been proposed
to this end excerpts  have been proposed
the knowledge regarding the vocabulary by allowing for a degree of semantic loss
to this end minimal modules  have been proposed
to this end certain small number of axioms that best capture the knowledge  have been proposed
in this paper we introduce the notion of subsumption justification as an extension of justification  a minimal set of axioms needed to preserve a logical consequence  to capture the subsumption knowledge between a term in the vocabulary
in this paper we introduce the notion of subsumption justification as an extension of justification  a minimal set of axioms needed to preserve a logical consequence  to capture the subsumption knowledge between all other terms in the vocabulary
we present algorithms for computing subsumption justifications based on a simulation notion developed for the problem of deciding the logical difference between ontologies
we show how subsumption justifications can be used to obtain minimal modules
we show how subsumption justifications can be used to compute best excerpts by additionally employing a partial maxsat solver
this yields two stateoftheart methods for computing all best excerpts which we evaluate over large biomedical ontologies
