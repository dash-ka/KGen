An increasing number of use cases require a timely extraction of nontrivial knowledge from semantically annotated data streams especially on the Web and for the Internet of Things
expressive reasoning which is challenging to compute on large streams
Often a timely extraction of nontrivial knowledge requires expressive reasoning
a new reasoner that supports a pragmatic nontrivial fragment of the logic LARS
We propose Laser a new reasoner
the logic LARS which extends Answer Set Programming for streams
At Laser a new reasoner Laser implements a novel evaluation procedure
the logic LARS which extends Programming RRB for streams core
a novel evaluation procedure which annotates formulae to avoid the recomputation of duplicates at multiple time points

a novel evaluation procedure which annotates formulae to avoid the recomputation of duplicates at multiple time points
a novel evaluation procedure is responsible for significantly better runtimes than the ones of other stateoftheart systems like CSPARQL solver Clingo
an implementation of LARS which runs on the Programming
other stateoftheart systems like CSPARQL which runs on the Programming
other stateoftheart systems like CQELS which runs on the Programming
a novel evaluation procedure is responsible for significantly better runtimes than the ones of an implementation of LARS solver Clingo

This opens the door to a wider range of stream reasoning use cases
This enables the application of expressive logicbased reasoning to large streams
