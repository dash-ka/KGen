valuable sources of information for various applications ranging from Web search to Knowledge Base  KB  augmentation
Web tables constitute valuable sources of information for various applications
entities published in Web KBs
An underlying common requirement is to annotate the rows of Web tables with semantically rich descriptions of entities
an ontology matching method which exploits instance information of entities available both in a KB
In this paper we evaluate three unsupervised annotation methods a semantic embeddings method
In this paper we evaluate three unsupervised annotation methods an ontology matching method
In this paper we evaluate three unsupervised annotation methods a lookupbased method
the minimal entity context provided in Web tables to discover correspondences to the KB
a semantic embeddings method that exploits a vectorial representation of the rich entity context in a KB to identify the most relevant subset of entities in the Web table
an ontology matching method which exploits schematic information of entities available both in a KB
a lookupbased method which relies on the minimal entity context
an ontology matching method which exploits schematic information of entities available both in a Web table
an ontology matching method which exploits instance information of entities available both in a Web table
a new largescale benchmark created using Wikipedia tables
we experimental evaluation is conducted using two existing benchmark data sets in addition to a new largescale benchmark
one benchmark data set
we results show that we novel lookupbased method outperforms stateoftheart lookupbased methods the semantic embeddings method outperforms lookupbased methods in one benchmark data and the lack of a rich schema in Web tables can limit the ability of ontology matching tools in performing highquality table annotation
a hybrid method that significantly outperforms individual methods on all the benchmarks
As a result we propose a hybrid method
