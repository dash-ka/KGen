web tables constitute valuable sources of information for various applications
valuable sources of information for various applications ranging from web search to knowledge base  kb  augmentation
an underlying common requirement is to annotate the rows of web tables with semantically rich descriptions of entities
entities published in web kbs
an ontology matching method which exploits instance information of entities available both in a web table
the minimal entity context provided in web tables to discover correspondences to the kb
in this paper we evaluate three unsupervised annotation methods a semantic embeddings method
an ontology matching method which exploits schematic information of entities available both in a web table
in this paper we evaluate three unsupervised annotation methods a lookupbased method
an ontology matching method which exploits instance information of entities available both in a kb
in this paper we evaluate three unsupervised annotation methods an ontology matching method
a semantic embeddings method that exploits a vectorial representation of the rich entity context in a kb to identify the most relevant subset of entities in the web table
a lookupbased method which relies on the minimal entity context
an ontology matching method which exploits schematic information of entities available both in a kb
we experimental evaluation is conducted using two existing benchmark data sets in addition to a new largescale benchmark
a new largescale benchmark created using wikipedia tables
one benchmark data set
we results show that we novel lookupbased method outperforms stateoftheart lookupbased methods the semantic embeddings method outperforms lookupbased methods in one benchmark data and the lack of a rich schema in web tables can limit the ability of ontology matching tools in performing highquality table annotation
as a result we propose a hybrid method
a hybrid method that significantly outperforms individual methods on all the benchmarks
