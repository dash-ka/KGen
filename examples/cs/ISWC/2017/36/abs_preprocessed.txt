Entity alignment is the task of finding entities in two knowledge bases
two knowledge bases that represent the same realworld object
When facing entities in two knowledge bases in different natural languages conventional crosslingual entity alignment methods rely on machine translation to eliminate the language barriers
These approaches often suffer from the uneven quality of translations between languages
While recent embeddingbased techniques encode relationships in the entities in two knowledge bases a significant number of attributes remain largely unexplored
While recent embeddingbased techniques encode entities in the entities in two knowledge bases a significant number of attributes remain largely unexplored
While recent embeddingbased techniques do not need machine translation for crosslingual entity alignment a significant number of attributes remain largely unexplored
In this paper we propose a joint attributepreserving embedding model for crosslingual entity alignment
further refines a joint attributepreserving embedding model for crosslingual entity alignment by leveraging attribute correlations in the entities in two knowledge bases
a joint attributepreserving embedding model for crosslingual entity alignment jointly embeds the structures of two entities in two knowledge bases into a unified vector space
Our experimental results on realworld datasets show that this approach significantly outperforms the stateoftheart embedding approaches for crosslingual entity alignment
methods based on machine translation
Our experimental results on realworld datasets show that this approach could be complemented with methods
