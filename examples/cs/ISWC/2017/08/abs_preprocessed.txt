In this paper we introduce SemCNN a deep Convolutional Neural Network  CNN  model contained in crisisrelated social media content
a deep Convolutional Neural Network  CNN  model designed for identifying the category of information
a wide Convolutional Neural Network  CNN  model designed for identifying the category of information
In this paper we introduce SemCNN a wide Convolutional Neural Network  CNN  model contained in crisisrelated social media content
semantics that represents the named entities in the text
Unlike previous models the proposed model integrates an additional layer of semantics into a wide CNN network
Unlike previous models the proposed model integrates an additional layer of semantics into a deep CNN network
previous models which mainly rely on the lexical representations of words in the text
the baselines which consist of statistical deep learning models
the baselines which consist of nonsemantic deep learning models
Results show that the proposed model consistently outperforms the baselines
