ontologybased systems that process data is received over time as in contextaware systems
data stemming from different sources
data stemming from that
in ontologybased systems reasoning should be resilient against inconsistencies in the data
in ontologybased systems reasoning needs to cope with the temporal dimension
motivated by such settings this paper addresses the problem of handling inconsistent data in a temporal version of ontologybased query answering
three inconsistencytolerant semantics that have been introduced for querying inconsistent description logic knowledge bases
this setting three inconsistencytolerant semantics
proposed temporal query language that combines conjunctive queries with operators of propositional linear temporal logic
proposed temporal query language that extend to this
we consider a recently proposed temporal query language
we furthermore complete the picture for the consistent case
we investigate their complexity for dllite  temporal knowledge bases
we investigate their complexity for  mathcal r  temporal knowledge bases
