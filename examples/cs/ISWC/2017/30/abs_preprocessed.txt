in many applications there is an increasing need for the new types of rdf data analysis
rdf data analysis that are not covered by standard reasoning tasks such as sparql query answering
one such important analysis task is determining what are differences between two given entities in an rdf graph
one such important analysis task is entity comparison
one such important analysis task is determining what are similarities between two given entities in an rdf graph
in an rdf graph about drugs we may want to compare ibuprofen
in an rdf graph about drugs we may want to find out that ibuprofen are similar in that ibuprofen are both analgesics
in an rdf graph about drugs we may want to find out that metamizole are similar in that metamizole are both analgesics
in an rdf graph about drugs we may want to find out that ibuprofen are similar in that metamizole are both analgesics
in an rdf graph about drugs we may want to compare metamizole
in an rdf graph about drugs we may want to find out that metamizole are similar in that ibuprofen are both analgesics
for instance
 in contrast to metamizole ibuprofen also has a considerable antiinflammatory effect
entity comparison is a widely used functionality available in many information systems such as product comparison websites
entity comparison is a widely used functionality available in many information systems such as universities
however comparison is typically domainspecific
however comparison depends on a fixed set of aspects to compare
in this paper we propose a formal framework for domainindependent entity comparison over rdf graphs
we model similarities between entities as sparql queries satisfying certain additional properties and propose algorithms for computing certain additional properties
we model differences between entities as sparql queries satisfying certain additional properties and propose algorithms for computing certain additional properties
