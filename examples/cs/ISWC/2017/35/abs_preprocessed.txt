In this paper we present perceived usability for SemwidgQL
In this paper we present perceived usability for Sparql
In this paper we present an empirical comparison of user performance
In this paper we present perceived usability for a pathoriented Rdf query language
We developed SemwidgQL to facilitate the formulation of Rdf queries
We developed SemwidgQL to enable nonspecialist developers to integrate other semantic data sources into standard web applications
We developed SemwidgQL to enable web authors to integrate Linked Data into standard web applications

We developed SemwidgQL to enable web authors to integrate other semantic data sources into standard web applications
a user study in which participants wrote a set of queries in both languages
We performed a user study
We measured both objective performance to a set of questionnaire items
We measured both subjective responses to a set of questionnaire items
Results indicate that SemwidgQL is easier to learn preferred by learners
Results indicate that SemwidgQL is easier to learn more efficient
To assess the applicability of SemwidgQL in real applications we analyzed its expressiveness based on a large corpus of observed Sparql queries showing that the language covers more than 90percent of the typical queries
the typical queries performed on Linked Data
