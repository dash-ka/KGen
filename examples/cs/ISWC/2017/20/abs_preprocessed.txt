A prominent approach to implementing ontologymediated queries is to rewrite into a firstorder query
a firstorder query which is then executed using a conventional SQL database system
We consider the case where the actual query is a conjunctive query
We show that rewritings of such ontologymediated queries can be efficiently computed in practice in a sound
We consider the case where the ontology is formulated in the description logic
We show that rewritings of such ontologymediated queries can be efficiently computed in practice in complete way
A prominent approach to implementing ontologymediated queries RRB combines a reduction with a
a decomposed backwards chaining algorithm for ontologymediated queries
ontologymediated queries based on conjunctive
A prominent approach to implementing ontologymediated queries RRB combines a reduction with a
ontologymediated queries based on atomic queries
ontologymediated queries that are based on the simpler atomic queries also illuminating the relationship between firstorder rewritings of ontologymediated queries
Experiments with realworld ontologies show promising results
