a prominent approach to implementing ontologymediated queries is to rewrite into a firstorder query
a firstorder query which is then executed using a conventional sql database system
we consider the case where the actual query is a conjunctive query
we consider the case where the ontology is formulated in the description logic
we show that rewritings of such ontologymediated queries can be efficiently computed in practice in a sound
we show that rewritings of such ontologymediated queries can be efficiently computed in practice in complete way
ontologymediated queries that are based on the simpler atomic queries also illuminating the relationship between firstorder rewritings of ontologymediated queries
