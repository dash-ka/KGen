the task of answering natural language questions over rdf data has received wide interest in recent years in particular in the context of the series of qald benchmarks
the task of answering natural language questions over rdf data consists of mapping a natural language question to an executable form  so that answers from a given kb can be extracted
the task of answering natural language questions over rdf data consists of mapping a natural language question to eg sparql so that answers from a given kb can be extracted
so far most systems proposed are monolingual and rely on a set of hardcoded rules to interpret questions most systems into a sparql query
so far most systems proposed are monolingual and rely on a set of hardcoded rules to interpret map most systems into a sparql query
we present the first multilingual qald pipeline
the first multilingual qald pipeline that induces a model from training data for mapping a natural language question into logical form as probabilistic inference
a languageindependent logical form based on dudes 
dudes  that are then mapped to a sparql query as a deterministic second step
a languageindependent logical form based on dependencybased underspecified discourse representation structures 
in particular we approach learns to map universal syntactic dependency representations to a languageindependent logical form
dependencybased underspecified discourse representation structures  that are then mapped to a sparql query as a deterministic second step
features extracted from corresponding semantic representations
features extracted from the dependency graph
factor graphs that rely on features
we model builds on factor graphs
parameters using a ranking objective
we rely on approximate inference techniques markov chain monte carlo methods in particular rank to update parameters
we rely on approximate inference techniques markov chain monte carlo methods in sample rank to update parameters
we focus lies on developing methods
developing methods that present a novel combination of word embedding approaches for this purpose
developing methods that overcome the lexical gap
developing methods that present a novel combination of machine translation for this purpose
as a proof of concept for we approach we evaluate our approach on the qald6 datasets for english german spanish
