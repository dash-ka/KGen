we present proof of soundness for an expressive schema language for rdf graphs
rdf graphs that is the foundation of shape expressions language 20
we present a formal semantics for an expressive schema language for rdf graphs
we present a formal semantics for shapes schemas
we present proof of soundness for shapes schemas
it can be used to constrain the admissible properties for nodes in that graph
it can be used to describe the vocabulary
it can be used to constrain the admissible values for nodes in that graph
it can be used to describe the structure of an rdf graph
a typing mechanism called shapes against which nodes of the graph can be checked
the language defines a typing mechanism
the language includes cardinality constraints for the number of allowed occurrences of a property
the language includes an algebraic grouping operator for the number of allowed occurrences of a property
the language includes a choice operator for the number of allowed occurrences of a property
shapes can be combined using boolean operators
shapes can use possibly recursive references to other shapes
