Wikidata is a collaborativelyedited knowledge graph Wikidata expresses knowledge in the form of subjectpropertyvalue triples
subjectpropertyvalue triples which can be enhanced with references to add provenance information
Understanding the quality of Wikidata is key to Wikidata widespread adoption as a knowledge resource
We analyse one aspect of Wikidata quality provenance in terms of relevance of Wikidata external references
We analyse one aspect of Wikidata quality provenance in terms of authoritativeness of Wikidata external references
We follow a twostaged approach
First We perform a crowdsourced evaluation of references
Second We use the judgements
the judgements collected in the first stage to train a machine
a machine learning model to predict reference quality on a largescale
The features learning models were related to reference the semantics of the triples the triples referred to
The features chosen for The machine
The features learning models were related to reference editing the triples referred to
 61percent  of the references evaluated were authoritative
 61percent  of the references evaluated were relevant
links that changed
links that either stopped working or pointed to other pages
Bad references were often links
The machine learning models were able to accurately predict nonrelevant references
The machine learning models were able to accurately predict nonauthoritative references
The machine learning models outperformed the baseline
Further work should focus on implementing our approach in Wikidata to help editors find bad references
