the federation of different data sources gained increasing attention due to the continuously growing amount of data
but the more data are available from heterogeneous sources the higher the risk is of inconsistency
to tackle this challenge in federated knowledge bases we propose a fully automated approach for computing trust values at different levels of granularity
gathering both the conflict graph generated by inconsistency detection and resolution we create a markov network to facilitate the application of gibbs sampling to compute a probability for each conflicting assertion

based on which trust values for each integrated data source respective signature elements are computed
