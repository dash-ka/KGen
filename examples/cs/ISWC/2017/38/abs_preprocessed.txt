A conditional key is a key constraint
a key constraint that is valid in only a part of the data
In this paper we show how such keys can be mined automatically on large knowledge bases
For this we combine techniques from key mining with techniques from rule mining
we show that we method can scale to large knowledge bases of millions of facts
we also show that the conditional keys we we can improve the quality of entity linking by up to 47percent points
