In modelling realworld knowledge there often arises a need to represent
In modelling realworld knowledge there often arises reason with metaknowledge
To equip description logics for dealing with such ontologies we allow concept inclusions to express constraints on annotations
To equip description logics for dealing with such ontologies we enrich description logic concepts and roles with finite sets of attributevalue pairs called annotations
we show that this may lead to increased complexity
we show that this may lead to even undecidability
we identify cases where this increased expressivity can be achieved without incurring increased complexity of reasoning
In particular
we cover the description logic
we describe a tractable fragment based on mathcal EL 
we describe a tractable fragment based on the lightweight description logic 
the description logic underlying OWL 2 description logic
we cover  mathcal SROIQ
