a languageagnostic approach that builds machine learning models only from languageindependent features
a languageagnostic approach that exploits background knowledge from the graph instead of languagespecific techniques
while most existing approaches use languagespecific methods  usually for english  we present a languageagnostic approach
we demonstrate the extraction of relations from wikipedia abstracts
the extraction of relations from wikipedia abstracts using the twelve largest language editions of wikipedia
from those we can extract 16 m new relations in dbpedia at a level of precision of 95percent using a randomforest classifier
a randomforest classifier trained only on languageindependent features
the information extracted
furthermore we show an exemplary geographical breakdown of the information
