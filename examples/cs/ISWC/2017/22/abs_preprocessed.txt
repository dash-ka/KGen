a languageagnostic approach that exploits background knowledge from the graph instead of languagespecific techniques
While most existing approaches use languagespecific methods  usually for English  we present a languageagnostic approach
a languageagnostic approach that builds machine learning models only from languageindependent features
We demonstrate the extraction of relations from Wikipedia abstracts
the extraction of relations from Wikipedia abstracts using the twelve largest language editions of Wikipedia
a RandomForest classifier trained only on languageindependent features
From those we can extract 16 M new relations in DBpedia at a level of precision of 95percent using a RandomForest classifier
Furthermore we show an exemplary geographical breakdown of the information
the information extracted
