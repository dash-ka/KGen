Finding the commonalities between descriptions of knowledge is a foundational reasoning problem of Machine Learning
Finding the commonalities between descriptions of data is a foundational reasoning problem of Machine Learning
It was formalized in the early 70s as computing a least general generalization   mathtt lgg   of such descriptions
We revisit this wellestablished problem in the SPARQL query language for RDF graphs
In particular
In by contrast to the literature
crucially when background knowledge is available as RDF Schema ontological constraints we take advantage of the literature to devise much more precise  s as we experiments on the popular DBpedia dataset show
we address the literature for the entire class of conjunctive SPARQL queries aka Basic Graph Pattern Queries
