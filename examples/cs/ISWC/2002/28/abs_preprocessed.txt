Therefore the need for B2B marketplaces is to reclassify products according to different standardization models
Therefore the need for B2C marketplaces is to reclassify products according to different standardization models
Therefore the need for B2C marketplaces is to reclassify goods according to different standardization models
Therefore the need for B2B marketplaces is to reclassify goods according to different standardization models
This paper aims to face this problem by suggesting the use of a semiautomatic methodology to define the mapping among different ecommerce product classification standards
a semiautomatic methodology supported by a tool
a semiautomatic methodology was developed for the MOMIS system within the Intelligent Integration of Information research area
a semiautomatic methodology supported by a tool RRB

We describe We extension to the methodology
the methodology that makes our extension applyable in general to product classification standard by selecting a fragment of eclss standard
