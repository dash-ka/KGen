resources documenting subjects
topic maps have been developed in order to represent the structures of relationships between subjects independently of resources
topic maps have been developed in order to allow standard representation and interoperability of such structures
the iso 13250 xtm specification have provided a robust syntactic xml representation
a robust syntactic xml representation allowing interchange of topic maps
a robust syntactic xml representation allowing processing of topic maps
but topic maps have so far suffered from a lack of formal description
but topic maps have so far suffered from conceptual model
we propose here such a model based on the mathematical notions of connexity
we propose here such a model based on the mathematical notions of hypergraph
a model provides ways to check semantic consistency of topic maps
a model addresses the critical issue of topic map organization in semantic layers
moreover a model seems generic enough to be used as a foundation for other semantic standards like rdf
