The advantage of the RDFDAMLOIL family of languages over ordinary XML is that the RDFDAMLOIL family of languages over ordinary XML is composable
However the RDFDAMLOIL family of languages over ordinary XML expressivity is severely limited
reification in which RDF is used to describe formulas in a richer language
This limitation is well known
the usual remedy is reification
reification which handles bound variables cleanly
We propose a method for encoding typed predicate calculus using reification
reification which causes the size to increase by only a constant multiple
PDDAML which encodes domain specifications in PDDL
PDDL using we technique
a method generalizes to virtually any system a claim which we illustrate by describing we program PDDAML
we argue that reification while logically suspect is in practice benign because any algorithm capable of doing inferences using logical notations can be easily extended to  unreify  those notations as needed
we also argue that the ability to represent predicate calculus on the semantic web is crucial
