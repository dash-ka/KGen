some modeling aspects that have to be addressed in the context of the integration of autonomous XML resources
This paper deals with some modeling aspects
the emphasis of This paper is neither on on This paper technical details
We propose an integration system
the emphasis of This paper is neither on This paper algorithmic aspects technical details
Instead We focus on the significance of offering appropriate highlevel primitives and mechanisms for representing the semantics of XML data
We posit that support for such primitives and mechanisms is a prerequisite for realizing the goals of the semantic Web
