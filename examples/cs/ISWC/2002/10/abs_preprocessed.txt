this paper deals with some modeling aspects

the emphasis of this paper is neither on this paper algorithmic aspects technical details
we propose an integration system
instead we focus on the significance of offering appropriate highlevel primitives and mechanisms for representing the semantics of xml data
we posit that support for such primitives and mechanisms is a prerequisite for realizing the goals of the semantic web
