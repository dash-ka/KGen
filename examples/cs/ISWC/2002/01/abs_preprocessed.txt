problem solving across dynamic distributed collaborations
an emerging computational infrastructure that enables resource sharing
distributed collaborations that have come to be known as virtual organizations
Grids are an emerging computational infrastructure
an emerging computational infrastructure that coordinated problem
Unlike the web the Grid provides a range of fundamental mechanisms for sharing diverse types of resource such as computers
the web which primarily focuses on the sharing of information
Unlike the web the Grid provides a range of fundamental mechanisms for sharing diverse types of resource such as software
Unlike the web the Grid provides a range of fundamental mechanisms for sharing diverse types of resource such as storage
Unlike the web the Grid provides a range of fundamental mechanisms for sharing diverse types of resource such as data
Unlike the web the Grid provides a range of fundamental mechanisms for sharing diverse types of resource such as scientific instruments
In this talk I will introduce the Grid concept
In this talk I illustrate the Grid concept with application examples from a range of scientific disciplines
technology that is being developed for the Semantic Web
some of these potential areas of the Semantic Web technologies identifying those that I think offer the most potential
It is likely that technology will have important roles to play in Grid Services I will explore some of these potential areas of the Semantic Web technologies
