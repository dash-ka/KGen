in this talk i will introduce the grid concept
in this talk i illustrate the grid concept with application examples from a range of scientific disciplines
it is likely that technology will have important roles to play in grid services i will explore some of these potential areas of the semantic web technologies
technology that is being developed for the semantic web
some of these potential areas of the semantic web technologies identifying those that i think offer the most potential
