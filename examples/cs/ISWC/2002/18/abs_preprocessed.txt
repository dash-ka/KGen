Many RDF repositories have already been implemented with various access languages and mechanisms
The aim of the EDUTELLA framework is to allow communication between different RDF repository implementations
Part of EDUTELLA is a Query Exchange Language
a Query Exchange Language which can be used as lingua franca to retrieve information from RDF repositories
This work shows why we also need standardization of distributed modification capabilities
we describe use case scenarios for annotation services
we use replication services as guideline for we approach towards a Modification Exchange Language for distributed RDF repositories
