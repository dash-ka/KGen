many rdf repositories have already been implemented with various access languages and mechanisms
the aim of the edutella framework is to allow communication between different rdf repository implementations
a query exchange language which can be used as lingua franca to retrieve information from rdf repositories
part of edutella is a query exchange language
this work shows why we also need standardization of distributed modification capabilities
we use replication services as guideline for we approach towards a modification exchange language for distributed rdf repositories
we describe use case scenarios for replication services
we use annotation services as guideline for we approach towards a modification exchange language for distributed rdf repositories
we describe use case scenarios for annotation services
