we describe use case scenarios for replication services
We describe We extension to the methodology
We describe work on a conceptual model for querying RDF data that is suitable for application programmers
We have been experimenting with the query paradigm for working with RDF data in semantic web applications
we outline approach we are developing to address new requirements
We posit that support for such primitives and mechanisms is a prerequisite for realizing the goals of the semantic WebIn this paper we present DAMLS 
We present the conversion tools
We present the conversion tools limitations
We propose a formalised an initial reference semantics for The DARPA Agent Markup Language ontology for Services
We propose a formalised syntax for Services
We propose a method for encoding typed predicate calculus using reification
We propose an integration system
We propose here such a model based on the mathematical notions of connexity
We propose here such a model based on the mathematical notions of hypergraph

We report on the experiences of subjects
we see the communities where the knowledge is shared to be the main force in the creation of the metadata standards
We show how the discovered maps can be integrated into the document integration processIt is useful to express the location of a node in a semantic graph in terms of a sequence of knowledgebearing arcs
We show that the standard graph isomorphism algorithms can be used effectively for comparing RDF graphs
We take the vocabularies of product classification codes as a playground
We take the vocabularies of product classification propose a reusable map discovery technique based on Bayesian text classification approach
we use annotation services as guideline for we approach towards a Modification Exchange Language for distributed RDF repositoriesThis paper presents a layered for the Semantic Web
we use replication services as guideline for we approach towards a Modification Exchange Language for distributed RDF repositories
We work builds on the Semantic Web and presents a tool and exploits the formal representations to derive measures of trust in the content of Web resources

When moving towards networked markets more flexible approaches to B2B integration become necessary
While this necessarily imposes some restrictions the ease of integration into an existing this landscape is a major advantage
Within the scope of eProcurement solutions various initiatives take into account the provision of configuration services
Within the scope of stateoftheart B2B frameworks various initiatives take into account the provision of configuration services
With the current development of the technology acquired a new dimension
