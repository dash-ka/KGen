we propose a formalised an initial reference semantics for the darpa agent markup language ontology for services
we propose a formalised syntax for services
services which incorporates subtype polymorphism
the semantics we describe is derived from the semantics for concurrent haskell
the semantics we describe is derived from the semantics for erlang haskell
we contrast the semantics we describe with an alternate semantics
an alternate semantics proposed for the darpa agent markup language ontology for services based on petri nets
an alternate semantics proposed for the darpa agent markup language ontology for services based on the situation calculus
