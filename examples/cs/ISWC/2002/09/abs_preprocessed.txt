rather than using traditional inference systems
rather than using relational database systems
rather than using our solution bases on mainstream technologies like java
while this necessarily imposes some restrictions the ease of integration into an existing this landscape is a major advantage
we present the conversion tools limitations
we present the conversion tools
furthermore an extension to ruleml is proposed that allows javaenabled reaction rules where calls to java libraries can be performed upon a rule firing
this requires hosts to be javaenabled when rules are moved across the web
this requires hosts to be javaenabled when code are moved across the web
however the solution allows for great engineering flexibility
