rdf describes graphs of statements about resources
rdf is a fundamental lower layer of the semantic web
this paper explores the equality of two rdf graphs in light of the graph isomorphism literature
the standard graph isomorphism algorithms developed in the 1970s
we show that the standard graph isomorphism algorithms can be used effectively for comparing rdf graphs
we consider anonymous resources as unlabelled vertices in a graph
the techniques presented
the techniques are useful for testing rdf software
