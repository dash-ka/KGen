RDF describes graphs of statements about resources
RDF is a fundamental lower layer of the semantic web
This paper explores the equality of two RDF graphs in light of the graph isomorphism literature
We consider anonymous resources as unlabelled vertices in a graph
We show that the standard graph isomorphism algorithms can be used effectively for comparing RDF graphs
the standard graph isomorphism algorithms developed in the 1970s
The techniques are useful for testing RDF software
The techniques presented
