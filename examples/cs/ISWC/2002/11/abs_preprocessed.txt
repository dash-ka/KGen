Describing web resources using formal knowledge  is the essence of the next evolution step of the Semantic Web termed the Semantic Web
Describing web resources using ie creating metadata according to a formal representation of a domain of discourse  is the essence of the next evolution step of the Semantic Web termed the Semantic Web
the Semantic Web RDFS  enables the creation and exchange of resource metadata as normal web data
Resource Description FrameworkSchema Language  enables the creation and exchange of resource metadata as normal web data
In the Semantic Web we investigate the use of RDFS schemas as a means of knowledge representation and exchange in diverse application domains
In order to reason about the quality of existing RDF schemas a benchmark serves as the basis of a statistical analysis
a statistical analysis performed with the aid of VRP the Validating RDF Parser
The statistical data extracted lead to corollaries about the morphology of RDFS schemas
The statistical data extracted lead to corollaries about the size
Furthermore the study of the collected schemas draws useful conclusions about frequent misuses of RDFS syntax andor semantics
Furthermore the study of the collected schemas draws useful conclusions about the actual use of RDF modeling constructs
