The idea of knowledge sharing has strong roots in the education process
moving learning material into the web environment the current development of the technology acquired a new dimension

knowledge shared by elearning community
Learning objects are the chunks of knowledge

In this paper the educators describe the peertopeer infrastructure for sharing learning object the educators are building in Canada
POOL centrals increase the speed and breadth of the searches in the peertopeer network
an freely downloadable application which allows individuals to create metadata
objects connected to the peertopeer network
an freely downloadable application which allows individuals to maintain individuals collection of learning objects
PONDs are bigger repositories of learning objects
The POOL projects builds on the three types of nodes
SPLASH is an freely downloadable application
The POOL projects uses CanCore a subset of the IMS metadata protocol to describe learning objects
In the second part of this paper we discuss the future direction of this initiative based on the maturing learning objects community learned in the deployment of POOL network

solutions that are too complex
we argue that the standardization effort although very important currently provides solutions
we see the communities where the knowledge is shared to be the main force in the creation of the metadata standards
the metadata standards which would support the growth of semantic web
The implications of moving the responsibility for schemas on communities poses new requirements on tools
