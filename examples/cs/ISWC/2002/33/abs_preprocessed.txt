It is useful to express the location of a node in a semantic graph in terms of a sequence of knowledgebearing arcs
a node that is used as a point of reference
knowledgebearing arcs that lead to the node from a node
the arcs on which such  graphbased addressing expressions 
If the arcs on which such  graphbased depend disappear the expressions become invalid
