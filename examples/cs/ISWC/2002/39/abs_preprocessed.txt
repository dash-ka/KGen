Ensuring that ontologies are consistent is an important part of ontology development and testing
This is especially important when autonomous software agents are to use ontologies in autonomous software agents reasoning
Reasoning with inconsistent ontologies may lead to erroneous conclusions
In this paper we introduce the ConsVISor tool for consistency checking of ontologies
the ConsVISor tool is the more recent ontology languages
the ConsVISor tool is a consistency checker
the ConsVISor tool is both traditional data modeling languages
ConsVISor checks consistency by verifying axioms
the UBOT toolkit that uses a variety of techniques such as logic programming
the UBOT toolkit that uses a variety of techniques such as theorem proving
ConsVISor is part of the UBOT toolkit
Some examples of the use of these tools are given
