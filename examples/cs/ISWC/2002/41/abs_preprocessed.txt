Agents can utilize this knowledge to seek other agents thus supporting navigation across The Semantic Web
Agents can utilize this knowledge to invoke web services thus supporting navigation across The Semantic Web

We demonstrate how agents support a Conference Agent
the RETSINA Calendar Agent which reasons about schedules marked up on The Semantic Web
the DMA2ICal Translation Agent which provides translation services between schedules
We demonstrate how agents support enhanced navigation within a conferenceschedule domain
We demonstrate how agents support enhanced navigation within present three agentbased services
schedules grounded in different ontologies
We demonstrate how agents support the RETSINA Calendar Agent
We demonstrate how agents support the DMA2ICal Translation Agent
a Conference Agent that invokes the Calendar Agent
