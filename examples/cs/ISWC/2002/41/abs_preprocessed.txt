the semantic web promises to change the way agents harvest
the semantic web promises to change the way agents navigate
the semantic web promises to change the way agents utilize information on the internet
by providing a it is now possible for agents to reason about published knowledge without information agents
by providing a it is now possible for agents to read without information agents
by providing a it is now possible for agents to read without the need for scrapers
a structured distributed representation for expressing relationships
relationships defined by multiple ontologies
a structured distributed representation for expressing concepts
concepts defined by multiple ontologies
by providing a it is now possible for agents to reason about published knowledge without centralized ontologies

agents can utilize this knowledge to invoke other agents thus supporting navigation across the semantic web
agents can utilize this knowledge to seek other agents thus supporting navigation across the semantic web
agents can utilize this knowledge to invoke web services thus supporting navigation across the semantic web
agents can utilize this knowledge to seek web services thus supporting navigation across the semantic web
we demonstrate how agents support enhanced navigation within present three agentbased services
we demonstrate how agents support a conference agent
we demonstrate how agents support the dma2ical translation agent
schedules grounded in different ontologies
we demonstrate how agents support enhanced navigation within a conferenceschedule domain
we demonstrate how agents support the retsina calendar agent
the retsina calendar agent which reasons about schedules marked up on the semantic web
the dma2ical translation agent which provides translation services between schedules
a conference agent that invokes the calendar agent
