This paper describes an approach to derive assessments about information sources based on individual feedback about the sources
alternative information sources that can be contradictory
a system that helps users annotate users analysis of alternative information sources
We describe TRELLIS
We describe a system
alternative information sources that can be incomplete
As the user makes a decision on which to believe in making a final decision TRELLIS captures the derivation of the decision in a semantic markup
As the user makes a decision on which sources to dismiss TRELLIS captures the derivation of the decision in a semantic markup
TRELLIS then uses these annotations to derive an assessment of the source based on the annotations of many individuals
We work builds on the Semantic Web and presents a tool and exploits the formal representations to derive measures of trust in the content of Web resources
annotations that are in a mix of human language
a tool that helps users create annotations
