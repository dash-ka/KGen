this paper describes an approach to derive assessments about information sources based on individual feedback about the sources
a system that helps users annotate users analysis of alternative information sources
we describe a system
alternative information sources that can be contradictory
we describe trellis
alternative information sources that can be incomplete
as the user makes a decision on which to believe in making a final decision trellis captures the derivation of the decision in a semantic markup
as the user makes a decision on which sources to dismiss trellis captures the derivation of the decision in a semantic markup
trellis then uses these annotations to derive an assessment of the source based on the annotations of many individuals
we work builds on the semantic web and presents a tool and exploits the formal representations to derive measures of trust in the content of web resources
a tool that helps users create annotations
we work builds on the semantic web and presents a tool and exploits the formal representations to derive measures of trust in the formal representations original source
annotations that are in a mix of formal language
annotations that are in a mix of human language
