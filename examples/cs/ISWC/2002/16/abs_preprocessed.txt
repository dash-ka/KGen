advanced business document integration technologies performing intelligent document transformation
the web that require development of advanced business document integration technologies
the semantic web would enable new ways of doing business on the web
the documents use different vocabularies
different vocabularies that consist of large hierarchies of terms
accordingly vocabulary mapping becomes an important task in the whole business document transformation process
accordingly transformation becomes an important task in the whole business document transformation process
an important task in the whole business document transformation process includes map execution
an important task in the whole business document transformation process includes several subtasks
an important task in the whole business document transformation process includes map representation
map execution that must be seamlessly integrated into the document integration process
an important task in the whole business document transformation process includes map discovery
each using one of the vocabularies
in this paper we discuss the process of discovering the discovered maps each
we take the vocabularies of product classification codes as a playground
we take the vocabularies of product classification propose a reusable map discovery technique based on bayesian text classification approach
we show how the discovered maps can be integrated into the document integration process
