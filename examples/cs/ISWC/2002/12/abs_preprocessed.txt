the semantic discontinuity between worldwide web languages and xml xml schema and xpath and semantic web languages and rdf rdfs and damloil forms a serious barrier for the stated goals of the world wide web
the semantic discontinuity between worldwide web languages and xml xml schema and xpath and semantic web languages and rdf rdfs and damloil results from a difference in modeling foundations between logics
the semantic discontinuity between worldwide web languages and xml xml schema and xpath and semantic web languages and rdf rdfs and damloil results from a difference in modeling foundations between xml
we propose to eliminate the semantic discontinuity between worldwide web languages and xml schema and semantic web languages
we propose to rdfs by creating a common semantic foundation for both the world wide web taking ideas from both
we propose to rdf by creating a common semantic foundation for both the world wide web taking ideas from both
we propose to damloil by creating a common semantic foundation for both the world wide web taking ideas from both
we propose to rdf by creating a common semantic foundation for both the world wide web taking ideas from both

we propose to eliminate the semantic discontinuity between worldwide web languages and xml and semantic web languages
a common semantic foundation results in essentially no change to xml and only minor changes to rdf
but a common semantic foundation allows the world wide web to get closer to the world wide web goal of describing the semantics of the world wide web
other semantic web languages  including rdfs  are considerably changed because of a common semantic foundation
